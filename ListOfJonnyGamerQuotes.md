Suggestions for improving Hopscotch

Meta - Hopscotch

No

"Hey guy! I'm JonnyGamer new to the Forum

 but not in hopscotch. Um

 let's see

 I really think you guys should add a text button

 so you can communicate with your friends faster and share projects with each other. You could also ask for help with it to popular hopscotchers. The text button would be really great. Uh

 also

 the follow should be more like 'friend' to communicate better and see what they are doing like a mini blog

 or a new level they are creating. I will post more ideas later..."

Ideas for a *NEW HOPSCOTCH UPDATE*

"I think a 'Text me!' would be great to add to hopscotch profiles. You can text your friends faster and send them your projects for group editing. Also I think that the following should be more like friending so you can see what their doing and follow a 'blog' that they post. Thanks for reading

 I'll post more soon! 

- JonnyGamer"

Texting In Hopscotch?!?

"Hey guys! This is a great idea I've been thinking about. I thought that if we could make a 'Text Me!' button so you can communicate faster. Also

 you could share projects with your friends maybe even before you've published them

 so you could make mega collabs. I think this would be a great way to have people help each others

 and ask for help from popular hopscotchers. Thanks!

"The site itself is a little buggy

 but especially posting things take a while."

"What I was thinking was having a small text button on the bottom of the screen and if someone new wanted to text you

 a notification would appear. It would also say if you want to accept their text request so you don't receive tons of random messages from weirdos. I also think that it should add

 when your texting someone

 an ability to post a project your working on so you can share it without publishing it. :smiley:"

"Here are some ideas I've drawn!

"Hello

 sorry I was not clear before

 but I really don't want hopscotch to be more social media

 I just wanted the texting app to be another resource to share ideas with friends. Like I said earlier

 when someone you don't know requests to text with you

 you can deny it. Also

 you can always block them in the edit mode

 sorry the picture was blurry. Thanks for your response!

-JonnyGamer"

"Yah

 I know

 I'm perfectly fine. I'm just trying to make the idea better. ;)"

Does anyone else have ideas about messenging?

Banyan Perspective Bug!

Bugs with Hopscotch|Bugs in player

"i found a bug! Please fix! It looks like the banyan Sprite has been badly made... :frowning: 

![|666x500](upload://99Gr93ocp2ttuupQtpnE8PxfqVD.png)"

What happened to #challenges?

Deprecated

"You know

 not many people really used it anyway

 so I think that the Hopscotch team removed it for space and simplism. Sorry."

Nope. It was just a one time bug. I realized it didn't happen in a different project I made

Phase Company (no more room)

"I would love to! Sorry about the wait

 but I just joined yester day and it didn't allow me to post anything more than 10... I just need to download that latest version!"

I would love to join!

"Thanks

 I figured out that this was a one time bug in my device. Thankfully

 it's nothing major!"

 @t1 ! My little brother has a similar app that does the same thing. I will definitely put the pictures there. I had not thought of that. :open_mouth:"

Hey guys! Can I have the user code! I love programming on Hopscotch and I can definitely do a fruit ninja game. I would love to be on the team!

"Hey dude

 you found a prize. Tell JonnyGamer the secret Passcode: Never ride a buffalo in public"

"Hey guys! Sorry I have not been on the forum for a while... Anyway

 I was thinking that on here (or a new filter slot for hopscotch) that we could put on cool projects from other people or us that we think should deserve to be in a video! Thanks!

Here is a list that I'll keep on adding to for games in case this gets to big:

‚Ä¢Gravity Cube v1.3 -JonnyGamer

‚Ä¢Gravitation -MobCraft

‚Ä¢#BTPPMN15 -Rawrbear

You guys can think of the rest :wink:"

I remember that! Those were the good old days!

3D Minecraft Game?!

I hope you don't run out of characters! That would be a bummer.

"Tell me when these awesome ideas are created are made

 then I'll add them"

"Hey

 @MagmaPOP . I think the minecraft idea is super cool. After you finish that

 another challenging game would be Viva Pi√±ata. If you haven't heard of it

 look it up. It is super cool! I think it would be a great challenge. I tried to make it

 but I couldn't figure out how to make the clones... They really need to make a video for that. Anyway

 the graphics in it are super cool!"

":smiley:

A Cool Idea For Hopscotch

"We need a z block. A z block should have a little type box in it

 like a normal one. For instance

 if you typed 5 for one character and 3 for another

 the 5 would be overlapping the 3. They really need to add this so there are infinite lavers instead of just 3."

"Basically

 if a sprite1 z layer is 2 and another Sprite2 is 3

 the sprite1 is underneath the sprite2. Then

 you can change the z layer using a   Block."

"I know but since that has only 3 layers

 the X block has many"

"I was going to do a song

 but the project doesn't want to play music..."

"@MagmaPOP

 I have made a really cool song for the minecraft video game! I had to create it on a different draft

 so you'll have to copy it from my file if you want to use it. I hope you like it! :wink:"

I'm going to publish it in like a minute so you'll find it under JonnyGamer!

There is an hacker

Did you know...We are all hackers on hopscotch? We are creating things on a program. The definition of hacking! Isn't that wierd?

Desƒ´n Inc.¬© wanna join?

"Hey guys! Desƒ´n Inc. is a company my brother and I are working on! We have put it in hopscotch and are wondering if anyone would like to join! Thanks! :smile:

"Not really

"Right now

 I'm working on a really cool project! I'm going to try to move it on the Desin acount"

"I made my song! MC song! It's very smooth! It wasn't branched from you though... @MagmaPOP. Anyway

 you should check it out!"

Would you like to join?

Sure! 20characters..

"Anything for now... We want to focus it more on games though

 and art

 and inventions!"

The account is Desin Inc. and pass is ----. I'll edit it later if you want to join

Do you want to join?

Mine is JonnyGamer. The collab is Desin Inc.

What do you want to work on?

The password is 8253

thanks! (20 characters)

You Can join any time you like! :)

"ok

 I'll move a game I'm working on onto that account! :)"

"I'll publish my game on my account so you can give advice

 or branch it!"

The game I'm working on is in the newest.

you can also check out the other projects I've made :)

"To: Qubertion

 but afterwards

 the UglyDoll game"

"Ya

 first

 there's the crouch. Ok

 there's a loading screen to make the background look nice

 the loading screen shows the character and abilities and also the goal. The first character is Babo

 the guy holding the cookie. In this first level

 you try to collect all of the cookies and get to the end. This may involve entering homes

 or interacting with other characters. After that level

 there are four more levels with different uglydolls with different abilities including flying

 double jumping

 or speed running! :smile: that's just the beginning though. I have to come up with more ideas"

"I didn't think anyone else has made different levels that involve different characters with different abilities. Plus

 they are all made of emojis. (My autocorrect is awful today...)"

Tell me if you have any ideas or changes

"It is a collab company that makes games

 art

 inventions

 cool stuff. You'll love it!"

"Its both! You make games

 art (designs)

 and cool inventions! :)"

And music too! :) (20characters)

"K thanks! I've already made emoji stuff for all of the characters

 so I'm not really sure about the squirrel idea. It took a while. But anyway

 I'll think about it!

I think that's also an amazing idea"

I'm also working on music for it too. It will need a redesign though (the game)

I published to: Qubertion2 it has music if you want to listen. Get to the part where the birds are tweeting then it loops

"Ok

 I might for another character

 I think tutulu

 but Babo actually likes cookies

 but I see how the nuts would make sense. Anyway

 I'll publish another project that has all of the characters!"

"I published To: Qubertion3

 it has all of the characters

 except Poe who has wings and I'm still working on it. Hope you like them! My brother actually create them!"

You should check out the song if you haven't yet. It is really upbeat and awesome!

I don't know how to do that yet. I'd like to figure it out. It'd be a lot easier

"                   ‚¨õÔ∏è                        Nut? Needs work...

              ‚¨õÔ∏è‚¨õÔ∏è‚¨õÔ∏è

           ‚¨õÔ∏èüâëüâë‚¨õÔ∏è

                 ‚¨õÔ∏è"

I'm trying to do the nut. I think the cookie looks better. I'm definitely having the nut be for tutulu.

No requirements. The loggin is Desin Inc. pass is ----

I'm going to make the UglyDoll game a separate topic because this one is just for adding people.

The UglyDoll game! (don't ask... just check it out! :wink:)

 everyone!  @Qubertion and I are working on this awesome new game! If you'd like to help out or give information

 please do so! :wink: I'll send links if you'd like to see how progress is going. Thanks!"

I'll add a pictures and type up To: Qubertion for a sneak peak!

Solving the hacker case?! üïµ [CLOSED!] (don't change title) üëàüèªseriously DONT CHANGE THE TITLE

Ya and the bright blue texts

"I know

 it was just kind of funny to run across it. I mean seriously

 why would someone warn people that he was a hacker...."

"Did you get iOS 9.1? Anyway

 I'll fix it to an emoji we all have. My brother was having the same issues too."

A finished fixing Babo. Whew that took a while!

"This good? I'll try the other acorn idea

![|330x319](upload://6WJIDMl85n5ODctKunMQlWy0i5t.jpeg)"

Nice! (20 characters)

"Finished shaded background...

Working on putting it onto the main app"

"Hey @Qubertion? Do you like that with the acorn

 Babo turns into Super Squirrell Babo? It looks cool!"

"That's strange... Anyway

 I updated it so hopefully it'll work. There's also a loading screen now and shaded background!"

I hope @MagmaPOP sees my song! It's really cool! It's titles MC song but it wasn't remixed.

I'm going to publish another beta called BaboBeta. Sorry the loading screen is a full minute. It is worth the wait.

"Yes

 big toe is real. We don't have him though."

We have quite a few ugly dolls in our house. That's what inspired me. I think they're discontinued though. :(

"I've extended the song to be over a minute

 I'll get the exact measure later but I'm still working on it. I've added chords too. :) I'll publish a beta then I'll focus on screens. I'm calling it BaboBeta mainly because it features Babo in only one screen. There's also an acorn that turns him into Squirrell Babo

 but it'll be in a different screen later. It's kind of like a power up

 I just haven't thought of what it'll do yet. I'll just finish the already long song."

"Woah... I've seen this before. The texts are at size 10 but zoomed up and pixels didn't update. It's a pretty bad bug though. Resize! :stuck_out_tongue: 

![|666x500](upload://jOfKZuCdU91jhLfrLWf7QDAlsff.png)"

"I finished song

 it's 1:11 sec. Enjoy! I'll publish BaboBeta. I might unpublished it though For securenessssss?... :neutral_face:"

Here's a link! (Finally figured out how to do it! ;))"

Hopscotch... What's this

Bugs with Hopscotch

"Remember when the hopscotch loading screen used to be higher and then the characters would rise up below it? Well look at this. At the loading screen

 put your iPad face down

 then turn it up and look...

![|666x500](upload://bhYSQY0Aj5rGUlg8D9H0icpzKVk.png)"

"it isn't supposed to happen. Remember when iOS 8 released the moving background where you tilted the iPad it would adjust

 well this is happening and hopscotch hasn't got around to getting rid of them and forgot about it."

It happens every time

 @Qubertion! Do you think I should work on extending the music or creating a new screen and fixing code?"

 it will also show if one is hidden and they go crazy trying to find it. One scene is inside a house and Babo has to checks cookie jar on top of a table. I'm having a lot of trouble making the pad say enter when Babo is on the arrow

 and control pad when he isn't. I wish hopscotch made a ""when something isn't touching something then do this. I'm sure there a way to do it with variables

 it's just really hard. It's kind of leaning me towards the side scrolling idea I had originally... :frowning: nevermind actually

 I think once you touch an arrow

 it automatically directs you to the next screen. You do have the option to go back though."

"[poll]

Sidescolling when move

Arrows that direct to different screens

Something else...

[/poll]"

When is @MagmaPOP going to choose a song winner?

"Hey @Qubertion! You know how in some games if you jump into a portal or something

 and when you respect

 it brings you below where you're supposed to be? Fixed it! :smiley:"

" Sorry

 I guess that is pretty annoying. I forgot it sent you a link saying

 oh look someone wants to talk to you. Whoops. Anyway

 thanks for liking my song! I was also wondering if you would like to look at that ugly doll game you've probably seen. If not

 take a look. It's pretty cool. If you want to help me out on it or give me ideas

 you can. :smile: are you going to reveal the song winner once you've released the game

 or before it. (Or after! nevermind...)"

 you should make sure what you flag is actually bad. I recently have been flagged for an innocent image from viva pi√±ata. Come on

"Ain't was on topic. I asked magmaPOP if he/she could do a viva pi√±ata next and posted a picture and MagmaPOP liked it and even enter me and some one else were talking about ages

I guess it could also create a hopscotch clean up team figuring out ho still has hopscotch. But who knows????

"Sorry I had a typo. It might have been though 

. Who knows...."

What level do you want to be in in the company. If you want to be in it. :)

"sure

 but just to tell you

 no one is a leader really. There are Cheif levels though! I'm Cheif Desƒ´n Officer! You can be co-leader if you want to! You can create a Cheif level also if you want!"

 but they deleted it later"

 but I'm getting it soon. It seems super powerful!"

"It seems familiar though

 doesn't it?"

"Ya. It does. They really need to add more soon

 maybe make a challenge?"

What should have been added in Hopscotch... (Idea)

We need a when something isn't touching something block...

Featured Cleanup

"Remember this? This was at the very beginning of Featured 33 weeks ago. What are the chances that someone would go here??? We need a featured cleanup team!

who is going to scroll down all the was to the bottom of featured just to look at a project? The list is extremely long no so the chances are 1/10000 ;)

"I remember the beginning. Before update 2.0

 the design was completely different. Naming objects were difficult. There was no send to back or bring to front. There was a yellow brick section

 and everything was kind of hard to understand. I think there are pictures online"

"Here are some screenshots!

"I just realized that. If they didn't do cleanup so earlier

 there would have been crashes and all sorts of stuff. They just need do it more often."

Hardest Game Ever!

"This is a new game I thought of last night and I need ideas! It is fun and addictive

You guys really need to try this! It is extremely awesome!!

 I kind of figured it might be a little long. I put it in my Radius V1 game

 (you need to check it out when you have time!) but when you restarted the project

 it made it weirdish. Anyway

 I thought about putting an in game restart button so the song would keep going

 and this is getting off topic..."

Please Help! A Hopscother!

"So ever since I've had my Flappymoji project on featured

 this person named

 ""A Hopscotcher"" has been annoying me with like spams. Basically

 he likes the same thing over and over again. Whenever I try to look at his account

 nothing happens. It even isn't in the search system. I think this may be an iPhone account

 all the iPhones were named: iPhone 283M81 or something. They got rid of those

 the Hopscotch team has resolved it. The project is deleted."

 I was wondering if there was going to be an official hopscotch Christmas project contest. I hope there is one because I've got a pretty cool project in the making! ;) -JonnyGamer"

How many likes on hopscotch featured?

"My project was posted on featured with only 20 something likes

 but I've seen one posted up with 1. (but they both increased in likes by a lot.) the lowest amount of likes I've seen on featured is like under 50 and it was posted on their over a year ago"

 that makes more sense. I knew about the iPad prize for the Christmas card

 but not if they were going to make a project contest."

 I agree with you @Follow4LikesOfficial

 I was also thinking if someone wanted to text you but you didn't

 you'd have to go through a process were the messages asks

 would you like to text this person yes or no. If they say no

 they can't ask you again until you ask them. Maybe there should be a setting were you can block everyone except for a certain few that you suggest. I would like this to be the least social media as possible. ;)"

 they may have different meanings for words. Probably in his language it meant something not as harsh. Who knows? When I saw that I did think it was a little strange

 I think he may be annoyed with all of the people begging for likes and stuff."

"@Funky63

 I agreed with you

 but it was a little edgy. Some people may not have understood the situation

 maybe you knew him? By the way

"I was thinking why would a mom be like

 oh if you get over ten likes on all your projects

 you can get a dog. If my mom did that

 I'd be like

 ""NO WAY!!!!"" Anyhow

 we don't know the situation behind this. Maybe the kid was begging for likes

 or maybe he was dead serious. Who knows....."

"Btw

 if anyone noticed

 the cookie dude actually did make the achievement. If he seriously did get a dog

 he'd make a project saying thank you thank you thank you

 if not

 it was probably a hoax..."

I Need Music For My Game!

 I can make a song! I'll hav it done today! ;)"

"No actually

 I used a few variables to substance each line to create the diagonal effect. ;)"

"Uh

 is there a bug? Why not??? Me confused...."

"Hey guys

 I finished my song entree! It's titled To: SabatogeWarning.

Here's a link

"Oh

 no! That's a bumber! I can post code for you

 @Rawrbear"

"Hang on

 people are saying the top and bottom... Which one is it?"

That's the code for the 3D green shaded background.

"I really don't like this arguement. It wasn't much of a big deal at first

 and now look what's happening! I think this was a big misunderstanding and there wasn't any communication. The rules of hopscotch say that you are not allowed beg for likes

 instead

 just have fun and create cool projects. @Funky63

 be careful what you say

 not meaning what you said was wrong

 but many people look up to you and see what you post. I personally think

 that we should just get back to programming and not pay attention to people begging for likes. Hopscotch is supposed to be a friendly community and not how popular you are base on the like count. Hopscotch is a fun tool to program on and share projects

  and us as leaders should be good examples for the others so we can keep it that way. Thanks! ;)"

"Sure

 I can make music! I'll have it done later today at most."

"Thanks! It took me forever to figure out because I tried to do it without variables and that took forever. Anyway

 I decided that I could do a simple variable subtraction algorithm

 and it worked! I'm going to make a game using it

 but I don't have any ideas. :("

You could be glorified like @MagmaPOP

I learned that from you a while back...

"Hey guys! I was thinking about this the other day. I created another account called Quantum9 on hopscotch to create some very interesting projects. If you'd like to check this one out

It uses 3D shading

 if you know what that means... (Not just shading)

@MagmaPOP

 I really think you should see this ;)"

"What does nvm mean?

 I know I won your music contest. :) When's the game coming out?

Oh

 nvm..."

Why are my in app notifications gone? Closed

"Hello hopscotchers! I was minding my own buisiness and I decided to check my notifications. I clicked on the Lightning tab and waited like ten minute to load. Sadly

 nothing happened. Anyone else have this problem? @liza @ian

Actually

 nevermind. They've fixed it."

 @MagmaPOP I was wondering if you'd like this idea! It's called 3D shading

 even though that was already made up

"Actually

 @GiraffeProductions

If you don't like it

 I can make a new one ;)"

2015 Hopscotch Yearbook

"This is great! Do a featured list for all the people on featured. (I'm assuming that's what game changers is

 right?)"

Woah! I had the same idea. I was working on it too with a lowered ground level but this looks nice! :) I was also working with the grid code too so it looks realistic.

"@t1_hopscotch

 I created a river in this also

Hopscotch: Wii U Edition?

"I would think that this is a good idea

 but a meh idea. First of all

 not may people own a Wii U so profits would probably not be good. Second

 the Wii U uses Java while iPad uses Obj. C

 so the switch would be long and expensive. This would be a fun idea

 if you can't use your iPad

 and instead use a Wii u. But also take in mind that how many kinds have a Nintendo ID also. Great thinking

 thoug!;)"

Unseen MagmaPOP Projects!?

"I don't know about anyone else

 but I can see it just fine. Wait

 actually this was posted 5 days ago... Anyway

 it seems as though it has gone through the filter. This is a bad bug. üêõ

 I was thinking that this project should add some drag gable game pieces

 you know so people can actually play it. I think that would get a game changer! (And add dice too!) ;)"

Epic Music Competition! üòÅ

 Hopscotchers! I was thinking the other day

 ""What if there was an EPIC music competition on hopscotch... But that wouldn't be too exciting... Hmmm

 what if whoever won would get a special prize..."" Ok

 enough with that. Whoever wins does get a super special prize

 but I won't say what it is... In this competition

 you must create a song

 (not by someone else

 yes

 with your imagination) title the song

 AND create a game to go along with it. If you can't do this

 sorry. Oh

 and by the way

 there are only 25 spots (including me so make that 24) If anyone would like to join

 just post below #ihavejoined and hopefully

 you will be joined into the competition. (If I like that post

 it means you're in) btw

 so I made the maxes be 100 and 1000. If you'd like to change it

 you can."

 are we going to make an exact copy of Radius

 or add a little to it? Oh and by the way

 what is the bear game about? I'd like to help on it

Is there such thing as parallel lines that intersect? A triangle with two or even three right angles?

"Is there such thing as parallel lines that intersect or triangles that have more than one right angles? Put your vote in and find out: please discuss below why you think your answer. This may be possible to create better 3D design on hopscotch and if you read below

 you'll find out why.

[poll]

- Yes

- No

- What is happening?

This is completely hopscotch related. The use of types of geometry can help games. I'm taking a poll to see who thinks this could or couldn't be possible.

"This is Hopscotch related because hopscotch is programming and programming uses geometry and this is geometry. This can be used for 3D design on hopscotch

 which you'll find out in a second.

There is no right answer to this question

 even though you all think it is false. The reason false is correct

 is because of Euclidian geometry. This geometry states that parallel lines can never meet or triangles can have a max of one right angle. The reason it is true is because of non-Euclidian geometry

 otherwise know as hyperbolic geometry. This geometry is on a globular surface

 not the surface of a plane. This make a few 3D shapes two dimensional. If you look at the longitude lines on a globe (up and down) they are parallel

 yet they meet at the poles. Also

 longitude and latitude lines can make triangles with three right angles (search it up on the Internet). This may not seem to make sense

 but that's ok. Hyperbolic geometry is used in 3D computer design and three dimensional video games or animated movies."

"The definition of parallel means that lines cannot intersect on a flat surface. In non-Euclidian math

 the surface of the globe is 2D which means that parallel lines on a globe may intersect. (That doesn't make sense

 does it...)"

"But in other countries

 it was posted Wednesday 1/20"

"In other words

 the people in other countries couldn't acces that post on Tuesday 1/19

 because that would mean they saw it hours before you posted it..."

 wait. Nevermind. You wrote EST."

"I'm very happy...

*silently going back to buisness*"

"Finished! Here it is:

"Look at this

Undeserved game changer

 and that was before there were shapes on Hopscotch. Kluni needed to find certain unicode characters

 which newbs would have no clue about. (I still want a Sprite kit!)"

Do you need my email? I'd like to help but I don't have the password.

Is it a profile on hopscotch? I'm confused

Ok. What should we work on?

Math.qopo (teaching math for video games)

"I had this great idea the other day

 ""Why not make a program that teaches math and shows geometry?"" I created this and I'm about to create other stuff too using triangles!

![|666x500](upload://pi8RgLaKPShBieVO4zXu5iXpiCG.png)"

I'm going to add that in the triangle one. This will be so cool!

"I have thought of a graph

 but if I draw it

 it will be cleared over and over again by the code. I have to try to make a Unicode graph

 and then change the code to make it different coordinates. This one is a v1 so I expect to add a lot to it!"

"Hooray! :0

 I think you may be the only contestant

@crazygoat  

You guys still in this?"

"Sounds awesome!

<jdmxjcjdd"

"Does it have a game?

Lol

 it can count."

Real Funky 63 Left?

"I was looking around hopscotch and I asked myself

 ""Why not get some inspiration from funky?"" I look around for his projects

 but there are none. I look around even more

 and I find this:

![|666x500](upload://vvAZLebCbcEjqtEdj7ilQnlqkj8.png)

I feel sad. He deleted all his posts and left Hopscptch

 probably forever.

@Liza @Ian do you know what happened?"

"If you look on his favorites

 he liked a project three days ago. Which means this is relatively new."

"That might be right

 but why did he delete all his amazing projects? Why not keep the inspiration going? Was it maybe because people thought he was a terrible person?"

Inspiration Wanted!

Be somebody that makes everybody feel like a somebody

"Fall seven times

 stand up eight."

"In the end

 we only regret the chances we didn't take"

"If 'plan A' fails

 remember you have 25 letters left"

![|666x500](upload://tLnVbBhCPvnruJioGHtA4KoNxTJ.png)

I still can't believe he deleted all of his projects! He must have felt really bad about it!

"All my life I thought air was free

 until I bought a bag of chips."

"If you argue with a fool

 you always lose."

"Gah! Here we go again. Why is everyone like

 ""Funky you mean!"" Then he leaves and everyone is like

 ""No! He was awesome

 though!"" Then people are like ""I wasn't involved"" and then everyone is like üòë.

Stop fighting! please?"

"Guys? Sorry to spoil this

 but the mystery liked is @Glitter_Kitty.

![|666x500](upload://lR1iSHykuhjRMF3kIdl7JHlcoMG.png)"

I remember most of you guys a long time ago. (Remember when there wasn't a community at all?)

Can you guess who am I?

"You're @Glitter_Kitty

 you're also @MysteryLiker"

"I actually started a month after funky 63 (old account). Wait

 that was the JnnyGamer account. I remember I think in 2013 I was there

 but not a community. Correct me if im wrong..."

I remember Ice Cream. :)

Um... Do you realize he's deleted all of his projects? Like sine and cosine and amazing stuffs?

"Also

 is Axotol still around?

Oh yes

 and @SabotageWarning

 it was unneeded to celebrate like that. Have you ever been inspired by him before he started going crazy?"

"Ok then? I thought someone said to mystery liker

 are you glitter kitty and he/she was like ""Maybe?????""... Gah! I'm very confused!"

 ok then. Never mind"

"Funky 63 Left- please don't celebrate. (Btw

 why was this topic closed @BuildASnowmam?)"

 then. I've never had one of my questions be closed before... Anyway

 please don't overly celebrate that he left. Thanks! ;)"

"What? I don't understand. Did you mean I can still post? Because I can't

 sadly."

Wait. Yep. I think. Uh... Nope. Like people can still read it?

"_slowly backs away

 ""Huh? What are you talking about?""_

 everything's fine."

"Oh! Sorry

 you wording was a little hard for me to understand. Yes. It was closed."

Thanks! It was sort of filling up my notifications list.

Otaku Music! All music-lovers welcome!

Is this music makers? Or music listeners? Or both!

"Yah. I was wondering...

_hahahaha_"

Do you guys know who F777 is? He's my favorite Techno/EDM artist! Look him up! :blush:

"My ultimate favorite of his music!

Oh my goodness. Dat was crazy

"No one answered my question earlier. Is Axolotl still here? She's been inactive

(Also

 don't you hate it when you are writing a post and before you post it

 the topic is locked?)"

"It's so sad. Well

 I guess not. Maybe they've moved on like obj. C?"

"Woah! Looks like a reflex/memory game! AMAZING!! Love the song

 too! Thanks for sharing! (By the way

 I do use newgrounds sometimes

 but I was introduced to it from Geometry Dash. There can be some strange stuff on there so I don't use it that much. I love the music featured on it!) I've never seen osu before! Looks crazy! I should get into that sometime

Edit: Apparently there is a free iPad osu! app! I really need to check it out!"

Ya? What? @justanerd

"Gap guh gap guh gap.

What's your favorite video game music?"

"Woah! Sounds like this osu! game is very intense!

 you're welcome for showing you newgrounds!)"

"This bot is strange. It should know if you open it back up twice

 then something's wrong. Why you do this! Bot!!!"

"Yeah. We saw that. Terrible

 isn't it!

 the Hopscotch Team has seemed a little dormant lately. Anybody else see that?"

How do you know if you've been flagged?

 I you know the little numbers near your icon? Well a blue number appears on the left side

 so you know something is really important."

I need music! 202020202020

"I can make you a song. What should the theme be like? Wait never mind. I forgot to read. Ok

 I'll work on it and it should be out later today."

#RememberF63 - A Community Project

"People were bully-ing him

 and he felt like Hopscotch didn't need him anymore

 look up to him

 weren't inspired by him...

Anyway

 people were just plain mean

 and he felt like the best way to fix it was to leave and delete all of his work. (He had so many inspirational projects

 I can't believe he unpublished all of them in such a short amount of time."

"Alright. @Day_Dreamer

  I finished it

 hope you like it! ;) If it doesn't fit with the game

 just let me know and I can make a new one. Thanks!

 I'll title it To: Day Dreamer

You can find it in the JonnyGamer profile soon!

Published it! Hooray!"

"Ya. Someone unpublished my requests project AND deleted the 2016pad draft. I had so much work on it

 it is such a bummer. 

The hacker is

ANUSH"

"I was joking about Anush. And by the way

 who published the derp face?"

Psyche! I liked it. XD

 bye! For me it's 12:34 pm. Lunch time!"

 this will be the biggest drawing pad Collab. Ever. It will have 216 colors and be a huge project. I will take only five members

 so look fast! I also need 5 HSB finders which they will need to find:

16 reds

 16 oranges

 16 yellows

 32 greens

 32 blues

 16 purples/pinks

 16 Browns

 128 tones (skin/hair colors and mainly darker colors)

 and finally

 24 shades. I will also need 3 beta testers to test things. Anyway

 how do you become a member of this Collab?

1. You must have been in a finished art pad Collab

2. You must be very dedicated with your work

3. You must finish assignments on time

 or they wait until it is fully really."

"Interesting

 right? (They should really make a color wheel. It would make drawing pads less laggy and much easier for HSB colors)"

Ok. Thanks for joining!

 I mean to choose a color with a dot

Yes! Please HSB find! Thanks so much!

"True dat!

Tug of War A.I. Please help

"Tug-of-War

Hmm. I have a great idea!

So

 tug of war is basically newtons and forces (newtons are the measure of force)

If you set a variable for you

 subtracted the variable for the computer.

If your pull is 3000

 and computers is 3000; the rope will not move.

If your pull is 2000

 and the computers is 3000

 the computer will pull the rope

And so on. If you don't understand it

 I'll try to make it less complicated."

 there are more Hopscothers

 right?? Well get votin' now! (That part was read in an overly exaggerated southern accent) Now is the time for a commercial brake..."

Oh my oh my!! We have 18 voters!!! Hillary has pushed up her lead

 leaving Bernie and trump to settle who will get the second place! This will be a pretty nasty one

 folks"

The Hillary voters are extremely active today! Hillary is crushing the votes at 42% leaving trump to eat her dust that was once at 27. Bernie is following close behind

 wondering if he'll take on trump. 19 current voters!!"

 or the repiclicancy... Ok... Anyway

 the heat is rising!!"

"I take no side in this public descussion

 things are tensing up!!!

No one can stop me from editing!!! Mua ha ha! News reporter for the win!!!

AND.......

Woah people! A special report! Build a snowman and Liza may be coming to this friendly descussion! Are they going to take part

 or are they going to close this topic and make everyone not know who will win this flabbergasting election... We will see

It just as though seems as kiwicute has ended the friendly discussion! Well

 that doesn't stop us from voting!!! See us next time on the next presidential debate!! Thanks for watching

 I mean reading!

AND......

The voting has officially ended

 and Hillary has taken the first round!! We will see who will win on the next presidential candidate debate and friendly descussion!

 it is time to vote!"

 while Bernie lingers behind at 33.3. Get your vote in before it's too late!"

"AND....

The fourth vote goes to Hillary Clinton! As of now

 the votes will be either of this three candadites. This will be a tense election

 people

 so get your voting in!"

"AND.....

Ted Cruz join the show

 triple tieing up with Hillary and Bernie. Trump

 still in the lead

 may be dethroned soon.."

The sixth vote makes trump and Hillary tied in the lead

 this will be a nasty battle. Who will win? Bernie and Cruz longer behind waiting for their turn to attack..."

Here we are

 folks! The seventh vote has been cast and Jeb Bush joins the debate! Hillary and Trump are still fighting for the lead. Vote for these two to see who will come in front! Meanwhile

 the rest of the candadites are following close behind. This will be a very intense battl- I mean election between the democrats and the republicans. Just one vote can change everything..."

"AND........

Things have been pretty slow lately. Votes must come

 people!! Anyway

 Ben Carson has just been voted for

 making everyone relatively close to each other. Remember

 one vote can change the entire outcome... 

*cue for commercial break*

And now

 have you ever wanted to buy a yacht???...."

There are ten votes!!! Hillary pushes into the lead as trump tries not to be dethroned. Hillary is at 40

 trump at 20

 the rest at 10 or zero. (Rubio isn't getting much attention) Get your vote in today so your favorite will win!"

There are eleven votes! Hillary deepens her lead as trump and Carson are trapped in a second place position. Who will battle this one out? Will Hillary make her lead further? Is Rubio not going to get ANY votes?"

"Sorry

 I was going to make a project. I advised people not to post on this one anyway because there would most likely be fights and stuff. Anyway

 did you get your vote in??"

As the voting thickens

 Hillary makes her lead more and more and more largened. This means that she is 25% on her way to win! (If I calculated that correctly...) I know most people do not want that to happen so...

Get your own vote in now!"

The discussion that wasn't actually meant to happen is happening! People are advertising who should win. Are they right? It's your opinion... Get your vote in now

 so the US won't be run by a creepo (Totally not directed at Trump)"

Another vote for Trump!!! As he pulls away from the behind

 Trump states that he will trump over Hillary's lead soon enough. Will that happen? Get your vote in now!!"

Rules of Forum Parties

"Aw man! I was gonna ask to have a ground hog day party

 but that was yesterday."

Trump is catching up with Hillary! Only eleven percent more

 if you want him to win. It is your opinion! Anyway

 let's talk to Marco Rubio! Marco

 are you sad no one has voted for you? ""Actually

 I'm fine. These are just kids! It's not the real election!"" K

 what if I told you it was... ""Wha wha!!!!!!"" And let's get back! Will Trump ACTUALLY trump Hillary

 or will she overpower. Let's find out!"

Hillary has the fifteenth vote

 making herself 20 percent away from second. Actually

 we have her here right now. Hello

 Hillary! Are you feeling confident for running for office? ""Oh yes. I'm confident. I can't believe that Trump snob is trying to over run THIS"" *over exaggeratedly points to herself* Well

 ok then. Thanks for being interviewed! Stay tuned for next time."

More and more votes are coming in to Hillary. Hillary is destroying the contest

 but Trump rolls on behind. Can he catch up and take her down? Or will Hillary consume all and become a power house? Stay tuned to see AND read the next one because Trump is going to be interviewed next! Thanks again

 and get your vote in now!"

As the voting tenses

 we will be interviewing

 Donald Trump! *booing rolls throughout the audience...* Anyway

 here he is! *Trump struts in as more booing continues* ""Well

 well! I guess I have a lot of attention!"" *Eveyone cheers because people have short term memory* Ok

 that enough everyone!! Trump

 how are you feeling about this competition? *Beofre trump opens his mouth

 a flower pot crashes down on his head

 causing him to be unable to speak* What! Who did that! That was unexpected.... Good thing that was a decoy! *The real Trump walks in

 and yells

 ""Me for president!! Yah!!!* Ugh. Ok

 Trump

 how do you feel about this competition?? ""I'm confident because I'm gonna win!!"" *Trump runs off* Well

 that wasn't much of an interview but

 thanks again? Well

 get your vote in now

 so your favorite will become the president!"

The voting has come to a short halt. In the meantime

 I will announce who will be the next interviewed person... That person is...

Someone special and you'll never know!

[/spoiler]

What! Who is it? Vote to see if your right!

- Obama

- Lady Gaga

- Will Ferrel

Hillary is voted for again. It seems as though she has taken the show. But

 there is still a chance a change could happen. Get your vote in to swerve the votes. Now

 for a motivational speech from....

*The best time for a commercial break! Haha*"

Thankfully

 no one has gone crazy with their posts. I thank you all for that. Now

 Hillary is ahead of everyone combined by ten percent. How could this be? Can it be changed? Will someone get a major vote boost? Who is this next interview going to be with??"

The polls have paused for a moment

 so now is the time for the interview! *crowd goes wild* Thank you! Now

 come in

 Obama!!! *crowd goes crazy wild

 while others boo. Obama AND his family walk in with golden outfits.* Here he is! The latest president! Now

 how do you feel

 Obama

 about finishing your run of presidency to the US? *Obama dances some epic freestyle moves and gets back up* ""Who said my run was over! I'm running for a third term!!"" *The crown screams again* Uh

 are you sure? The law clearly states that... *A needle is shot out and hits JonnyGamer in the neck. He instantly falls asleep while FBI agents take him away with Obama.* 

*Epic blackout and then... Commercial break!*"

*Everything suddenly comes back to normal* So

 Carson and Trump are battling out second place again. Hillary has knocked down a few numbers while Trump and Carson rise. Will they catch up? Or will Hillary take the cake (and then eat it in front of them) This is your chance to vote! Do it now..."

Bernie has finally gotten his second vote! Let's call him up! *Bernie walks in* So

 Bernie. How do you feel about running for president? ""Oh I'm totally gonna crush the polls!"" *He kisses his arm as the audience boos* Um... Ok then

 you realize you have two votes? ""Oh ya

 it's my plan! All my voters never vote me until the last minute! There for

 I'm gonna crush them polls!!"" Uh

 ok then.. Thanks for reading

 the other one was closed because people were fighting. I'm still reporting! ;)"

"Hahaha

News reporting! That's what I meant. Sorry

You should read them. I interview Obama"

Trump and Carson are officially tied at 16%. Who will get the next vote for second? In Bernie going to crawl up 4 percents to pass them up? Who will have the bragging rights for second? And the main question... Is Hillary cheating??? Lastly

 who will be the next interviewer??"

As Hillary stays in the lead

 I will be interviewing one of these three...

Who is it?

- Arnold Schwarzenegger 

- William Shakspeare 

- Anush!!

It seems the polls have been inactive lately. Maybe it's time for the interview! Ok

 who will it be? Come in

 Anush!!! *Anush is a little kid. He walks in with a huge bowl of curry* Hello

 Anush! Now

 not many people know you but- ""I'm Anush so give me curry!!!"" Oh

 ok. Anyway

 how do you think about all this- ""I don't care about ANyThInG!!! Well

 except if I don't have my curry."" *Anush runs around and tramples most of the audience...* Cut!! Cut!!!!!!

*Commercial Break*"

Wow! Carson pulled ahead of Trump! Is Carson going to catch up with Hillary? Who knows? There's only 26 votes. Anything can happen

 now."

Same and Empty Profile Picture Problem

"Agreed a third time

<rinfind"

"Next news report:

4:00 Pacific

@Kiwicute2016

 I don't see any flags... Why is it closed?

 I double checked. No flags..."

Presidential Election! #3

Huzah!!!! I'm back!!!!

"AND.........

 back on a new fresh post. Hillary is ultimately leading *again* at 58 percent. The nearest person to her is still kind of far. Trump at 16%

 but he can still rise up. Will Hillary stay on and claim her lead

 or will another contestant dethrone her? Vote and find out!"

 my email for drive is jpapp343@g mail.com

I love writing!"

 mostly the only way to do something is clones. My bit bird uses clones

 but it was very difficult to create"

The refreshing begins....

Hillary gets knocked back a few numbers

 but it does not hurt her lead. Bernie Sanders passes Trump by a mere one percent

 while the others are still sorting things out"

Got it!!! Yes!! Thanks

Hillary keeps falling down

 now she's at 46

 while sanders

 trump

 and Rubio crawl up there positions and fight eachother. How will this go? Who will officially win? Get your vote in

 folks!"

"Ok. Peace everyone! 

*news reporter out*"

It was a joke! Sorry for the confusion

Hooray! Thanks so much!

 it took a lot of time

 anyways"

"Finished! It's a little laggy becuase of the when something is touching something function. That's just a bug on hopscotch

 so on newer iPads

 it may be less laggy. Anyway

 here's the link!

HOPSCOTCH ~Truth or Dare~

Mua ha ha! Truth or dare

Mua ha ha! Storeez is fun!

"I can work right now.

 I was thinking when we've decided the prologue

 we can decide names for the next stories and then people assign their names to them and write them. That seems to be the best way"

Now that we have forty voters

 Hillary seems to be keeping her lead at 46. Bernie and Carson are battling out second at 15 while Trump is sneaking behind at 13. The other candadites seems to be unnoticed while Polio still has zero votes! Get your vote in everyone!"

Hillary pushes up after 43 votes! (By one percent) In the meantime

 Carson

 and Sanders try to make out who will be second. Vote for them to find out!"

There are currently 44 voters. Who will receive the 45? Is Bernie going to stay at 16 in second? Will Rubio still remain in last at zero votes????"

"Hmm. Seems familiar

The Hopscotch iPhone App Alpha

"I first saw this and it said

 don't get this on iPad. (It said many other things too like iPhone design is very different) but

 I got it on iPad. I can say that the iPhone app is well designed. The performance is a little slow

 but I like it. Also

 creating projects is fun

 but it would be nice to know where everything is (meaning all the time and not having to click a button to see it

 and then exit.). Also

 converting iPad made projects to iPhone projects is extremely nice! I can see a lot coming out of this

 and I love it a lot!"

"I think it may be the same app

 but it will just check what i thingy it is. (Wait

 that might be buggy

 so maybe separate apps)"

1. No laggy stuff to confuse people

2. Messaging people is a lot faster and easier

3. Posting of pictures and videos are easier

4. Docs is made for typing reports

 not messaging

5. You can still use the same g mail

6. The layout is easier to understand

7. You can also FaceTime (I dunno if that good or bad)

8. It doesn't eat up storage

9. You don't have to delete texts all the time

10. It's still google.

You can do one with me!

Is it possible to use hopscotch sounds to make a voice and speak English?

 you can

 but it uses HAX!!

Or

 you can go the hard way and combine sounds together and sort of make them bend and sound a little bit like human voice. I've tried that

 but it doesn't sound that good :( There are rumors out there that Hopscotch will add recordings!"

"When we all signed up for the Hopscotch Forums

 we all signed the terms of agreements. The terms of agreement states that we have all agreed to follow the rules

 for example we can't type certain things that may be offensive to someone. I think that we should all respect that and which words we are not allowed to use. I also think that talking about LGBT and being gay is not Hopscotch related at all

 and really shouldn't be mentioned. Even the Hopscotch team said that religions are not allowed supposed to be talked about because it can spark arguments like this. Lastly

 the forums are supposed to be about sharing ideas about Hopscotch

 not about religions or other unrelated ideas. I say if you want to talk about other things

 please do it elsewhere. 

Thanks

"First

 if you want multiple objects to move a certain distance

 you can create a value. Once a value is created you can set the value to a certain number. Then

 assign the value to (I.e.) movement blocks in multiple objects. Then

 all the objects will move that same distance. Then

 you can set the value to something else without having to change all the other movement blocks which takes a while. If this makes sense

 you can then add math to do all sorts of things. Hope this helps! ;)"

Help Hopscotch fix draft deletion bugs

"Many deletion bugs happen in collab accounts. Here's one that misfortunately happened to me.

There are saving bugs if two people are working on a draft the same time. One time I was editing a drawing pad and quit the app

 but had it still on the drawing pad while I was on another app. I com back and it reloads. I search for the drawing pad and it is GONE!!

Another bug/issue is if you publish a draft with no title

 it disappears from the community and there is no way to retrieve it.

One more thing: why is the beta app 15 weeks before the original? It makes everything confusing like publishing projects don't show up

 drafts I had deleted a while ago show up.

So even though I'm in 8th grade

 we got another five day lesson on how to make a research paper and stuff. Well

 the person who was speaking was saying how research papers weren't supposed to have opinions

 just state facts. We were all like

 ""we know"". Suddenly

 the speaker said

 ""oh ya. You kids don't even have opinions!"" Everyone's eyes widened and we looked at our teacher who was nodding her head in a way like she wasn't even paying attention with the slow motion blinking. We looked back and were all like

 ""Ah... He he... No."" It turned out to be an argument for the rest of the period

The Different Types of Hopscotchers!

"Here's my categorizations of Hopscotchers:

###The Game Coders:

These people code games; not much anything else

###The Art Coders:

These people make designs and stuff; not many games

###The all around coders:

Code basically everything

###The drawers

Draw things; very little coding

###The chat room peeps

These people want to communicate (ahem ahem messages update)

###The Collabers

These people basically are a mixture of everything

 but collating is the majority

###The like beggers 

They whine for likes

###Popular people

Take advantage of their popularness and create amazing things

Unless they're famous for drawing. That's different.

###Bragging popular people

Basically they are popular people who are like

 ""Look at me!!""

###The sort of popular coders

People know about them (they get 10-25 likes per project)

###The unpopular

Nobody knows.... 

###The no one knows about at all people

Not necessarily newbs

 but they get 0 likes

###The newbs

Either just joined and have no clue or they really don't understand coding

###The mix of everything

They draw and code

###The Haters

They hate on people

 but you might have known that

###The multiple accounters

They have many accounts not just one

###The true remixers

Remix projects and make them even better or congratulate creators

###The bad remixers

Remix projects saying they actually made them

###the copycats

Copycat coding ideas and get tons of credit

###the quitters

They quit"

 below the rectangles

 there's the word blue so people know. (Like they need to) On the right and left of the word blue

How can you edit posts?"

I might leave (maybe)

"@aabb1111

Why would you want to leave only because you don't get featured? I love hopscotch because you get to be creative and beneducated in the world of coding. If you love coding

 it shouldn't be because of whether you are famous or not. It should be because you love coding.

Even though the featured expectations are getting more lenient these days (I think I might make a topic about this)

 it used to be like this:

Is your project something new and innovative

Is your project carefully designed to the point you'd like everyone to see it

Is your project not a copy of someone else's

 but something you made yourself

If all of these are yes

 there's actually a topic on Nominations for Featured!

Just say your Hopscotch username

 title of the project

 and a link to the project.

 I hoped this helped! üòú

Let's ‚ìöeep the Forum Organized (Resolved)

"Hello Hopscotch Community

 I've noticed that there have been many topics being created lately that have no relation to Hopscotch or are not beneficial to ones skills at programming.

The Hopscotch Forums are for learning and helping each other out in code. Not general topics or random arguements.

Let us all keep the forum clean and organized as best as we can.

Thanks you all for reading ;)

EDIT:

We have resolved this topic

 there is no more need to post

 but anyone is free to read

 I also remember the days when it was hard to get 10 likes on a topic. Thanks everyone!"

"I agree

 have anything that we could change it to?

Why is k censored?

"I agree with all of you

 but I think that we should move general convo's maybe elsewhere?

Like.. Google docs

 messages

 other places?

 I think that we all are pretty good at being related to topics

 but I have been seeing a lot of unrelated posts lately

 I'm sorry if I offended anyone

 I didn't mean to. I just really like to see a nice forum where people can learn and hang out (I didn't realize that there were many of these topics

 I did some research

 could anyone help me out to find a topic like this?)

(Maybe I have a different view point because I've seen Hopscotch developed over the years?)

Last thing

 I don't know if anyone has noticed

 but Hopscotch (the app) has been getting a lot messier

 and I think that the forums were supposed to be a place where people who are really interested in the learning/exploring part. I don't know

 maybe it's just something to think about..

"Hello everyone! I am JonnyGamer

I have been using Hopscotch since August 2014

This is my General Topic where you can ask me anything

(Disclaimer: You can't ask me anything innaproprate or something..)

I love coding and I also love to draw

I like drawing detailed mazes

 which if you hunt around the forum

 can probably find

I also love math and you can ask me anything about that too

I also have 2 featured projects Flappimoji!

And Gravity Cube

 does anyone remember Flappimoji?"

I... do not know. I guess I was persuaded

"JonnyGamer

>202020202022"

Oh yeah! Want that the Roller coaster one? That was really cool

"Yeah

 level 5 is super hard for some reason..

If you want more of a challenge

 try Flip It v1.7

 I officially close this topic because I think we can all agree that the forum is being used right now for creativity

 and I guess that's what we should all be focused on! Thanks for clearing the up everyone!

 it looks really cool though"

I have not created a new version

 but I do have some older version prototypes!

They're called Flip it

 and I think I've gotten up to v1.7 with those

I had an iPad 3 back then and it was really slow

 so now the Cube movement is really sped up. I need to slow it back down

 the coding of the walls are a little buggy

 which were smoothened out in Gravity Cube

Here's the link:

 that was back in 2014..)"

"If by recent you mean posted over a year ago. Lol (67 to be exact)

Projects getting marked as inappropriate content by THT

"@Liza

Hello

 My brother and I are working on an account called JpDp Desƒ´n Inc. We published a project last night called Super Mario Minigames Coming Soon. We used an image and it was deemed inappropriate by THT.

![|65x100](upload://pXHxORnH0OMpUMbVFizIdAPda2w.PNG)

My question is

 are we allowed to use copyrighted images or is that illegal?

(We are working very hard creating the Minigames too ;))"

Super Mario Mini Games! Lakitu Drop is Featured! Wow!

"#My Lakitu project is Featured! Wow! Thanks a ton!

 Hopscotchers!

My younger brother and I are making Super Mario Minigames! You can play them here:

(Account: JpDp Desƒ´n Inc.)

Thanks! More are in the making!

 if anyone has any ideas

 you are free to help!

Yeah.. I forgot to fix that since my brother published that one. I knew I forgot something

"My Lakitu Project is featured!!!!

#Wow!

Thanks THT!"

Really? What do you mean??

"Hooray! I got my third feature!

(Except the account is under Super Mario Mini Games)

Lakitu Drop is my third feature hooray!

- I know you

- Idk. Who are you?

"I remember those days too

My Flappimoji and Gravity Cube were featured in the ""Really Awesome Features"" era along with MagmaPOP's series of games and all the other great greats. That makes me feel really old too having been on for so long

 I'm a boy)"

Global Variables?

Wow! My friend was talking about this same exact idea a while ago!

Super Mario Mini Games - #3 on Trending!

"Wow! Super Mario Mini Games has become very popular in just 4 days! Thanks everyone! Also

 I want to thank THT for the feature and everyone for the multiple trending and Goomba Stomp which is 3 on trending!

If you want to play Goomba Stomp V1

 Fire Bros. Battle is 5 on trending

 made by my brother! Thanks!

 we have 7 other awesome Minigames on our account!

 right? Exactly what I thought! Thanks!"

‚úîÔ∏èDoes anyone have a simple walking AI?

[details=We'll Mass Tag this]

I have seen people complain about The Mass Tag list currently in use

 and we need new guidelines. 

Please

 copy directly off of this topic when using the Mass Tag list. It will annoy you

 but it will constantly change. 

Here are the new guidelines for adding and using the mass tag list. 

-------

**Add yourself only** Do not add other people to the mass tag list. I'll see all of the edits

 so I'll correct you if you added someone else's name

 on accident or on purpose. 

---

**Don't use the tag list in all of your topics** We shouldn't be using the mass tag list in every single topic we or another person creates. It is annoying to have to scroll through that

 and it doesn't contribute to the discussion.

**Always use the current version** Again

 people will leave or take their name off of the list. Please always use the current version so we don't have to deal with people getting angry. 

**Please don't tamper with this list** It gets annoying when someone destroys something. So please don't tamper with the tag list.

 ---

**Only use this list for things you can contribute to** It gets annoying being tagged for smol potatoes. Things like projects and questions about rules create discussions

 things like drawings don't.

**Try to put the list in a dropdown folder** The list is getting pretty long

 so please try to put in in a folder.

**Put the list in the first post

 or the one to bring attention to** It's annoying to scroll up just to see what the user wanted you to see

 so if you're bringing attention to the topic

 put it in the *first post*

**Make sure to alphabetise the list** if it's alphabetised

 then it's easy to add tags and it can get confusing when in any order (guideline by Periwinkle Dolphin)

**Keep the count going** when you add yourself to the list

 be sure to increase the number by 1. I just spent all the time counting the tags and not all of them line up with the number (Also by Periwinkle Dolphin)

**Mention when you created guideline** people will easily know you did it and know it's your guideline (By Periwinkle Dolphin

 again)

If you have any other guidelines you would like to have

 add them here :wink:

Edit your name to this tag list.

Add a [/detials] directly below the mass Tag to condense it

"Can we not give ratings of people please? I know you're trying to help

 which can hurt what they see of themselves"

The forum as sorta become a go-to place where if you wanted to chat on Hopscotch

 now you can do it here.

It hasn't necessarily become creativity and helping people with code and the such

 but a chat room.

We need a new forum/place for these things and also a Hopscotch chat-room site

(Since really

 a chat room place isn't much different than what's going on here

 and also so we can filter general topics out)"

 @comicvillestudios! I haven't seen you in a while! (or ever

 actually)"

Adding suffixes to most swear words uncensormthe word because the computer doesn't recognize it as a swear word. It's one of those things the people who created the Discourse Forum might have left out.

How about a nice refreshing refresh

Who loves math?

"I love math! Hooray!

Time to get the suuuper nerdy math problems:

Question 1.

How many digits are there in 3^(3^(3^3) or simply 3^^4 using tetration

Question 2.

If an equilateral triangle is inscribed inside of a circle that has an area of pi

 what is the area of the triangle?

Time to make a topic!"

 Let's have a math competi.tion! (Notice! 2 more competing spots left!)"

"##Math Competition!

Think you're good at math? Give this a try!

 we are having a math competition! First of all we need 25 people to join the competitor team

 and 3 to join the judges team. I will give the questions.

###Rules

1. I'll post the question list once everyone is ready

2. When you answer the questions

 put them in a hidden text when you post them

3. The judges and I will correct the answers and we'll see who won

###Want to Join?

Post in the comments below

 and I'll add you on the list!

 on the third post

 there is a poll to say what grade level math you are in

###What Level math is this?

You will need to know basic algebra skills and geometry. You will also need to know prime numbers

 relations between square numbers

 factoring radicals and roots

 exponential power towers (tetration)

 ect. (Lots of fun stuff)

 that might have scared you a bit

 we are changing this up! When the math quiz starts

 a series of quizzes will show up in the Question reply above this one. There will be different levels of math per quiz

 so try the one you like!

###Poll!

- Elementar.y or below

- 6th Grade

- Algebra(s)

- Geometry

- Trig/Pre Calc

- Calculus

- I know a lot (or willing to risk it)

 I'm sorry if I hurt your feeling. I didn't mean to be rude if you thought I was

I also realized that I didn't put you on the list

Shhhh

 don't tell"

 Idk

<wwwwwwwwwwww>"

 I understand

I think a better idea would be having separate places on the forum dedicated to coding and inventing

 and the other dedicated to communication and being friends. That would make the forum much more organized and friendly

Or maybe when someone creates a post

 there would be more choices to what kind of post you're making instead of just ""help with code""

 ""collabs""

 and ""bugs"". Also

 what would make things more interesting

 would be if there were tabs at the beginning

 just like the ""Latest""

 ""New""

 and ""Top"" but swapped with the type of topic you are creating

I guess you can just tap the category button

 but it's not as nicely laid out as it should be

Do you think it would be possible for Hopscotch to do this

 or do you think the Discourse only has one unchangabole layout?

 wondering if you like math

I am hosting a math competition!

You can go to it [here](http://forum.gethopscotch.com/t/yes-lets-have-a-math-competi-tion-need-2-more-competi-tors/33672)."

Does anyone know how to make polls visible so that you can see exactly who voted for what?

"The show results button?

It shows me the results

 but not the icons of the people who voted"

 I see

Is that in my settings?"

 bummer

<jejendndndjwj>"

- Test

- Hi

- Don't click me

 I do not understand"

Prime Numbers Block?

"You can check by checking all the numbers larger than the square root of the number

 and dividing it by the number you are checking. Create 2 values for that

 round one

 and if the rounded number is not equal to the original

 that number is not a factor. Repeat until you check up to the original number

 and if no numbers divided are equal to the rounded version

 that number is prime

(Sorry that seems confusing

 I'll try and code it myself in Hopscotch)"

"2 more competitors open!

Just so you know

 if you don't make it

 the quiz will always be up so you can try it out! Anyone will be able to do it for fun"

 judges!

When I finish creating the quiz

 you can go over it to check if the levels are math are correctly in their place

(I would let you comment on a google doc

 but I don't think that's allowed)

But I might just make a Hopscotch account and copy the math questions onto it so you can see it

"There's a poll on the third post

It will be mostly all types of math

From 3rd Grade to Calculus and beyond

There'll be Questions fitted to each level

 then Questions will be on there that someone in that class would know"

So would you like to join as the last competitor??

"It means the same thing though

That's why all of our projects didn't bug out when they updated"

"I think we need to ask @liza about the ""rate me"" topic. I know it can fun to see your ratings

 but it can also be damaging to people. It is also awkward to rate someone very low when the polls are non-anonymous. I personally don't think we should rate each other

 I just want to know what Liza and THT would say. I guess for now

 rate at your own risk.

;)"

The Anti Rate Me Topic - (ARM for short) - (This is a serious situation)

 recently on the wonderful land called the forum

 there have been topics created called ""rate me"". These topics let people vote how good of a forum person you are on a scale of one to ten or twenty. This can be nice and fun to see what rating you are

 but it can also be very harmful.

""Rate Me"" topics can damage one's self-esteem. It can damage the way someone feels about themselves

 and it can harm them. The forum should be a safe and handy place for coders who are interested in being creative and imaginative. Not a place to see how others think of you.

That is why I want everyone to join the ARM wrestle (The Anti Rate Me struggle). Whoever agrees with this

 please share! ;)

 you may make as many puns as you'd like"

 that's odd. I'll go check further in the code

Maybe try it with a lesser amount of clones. That may be fix your issue.

 I notice that it says: When self bumps circle

This may refer to itself and the other circles since they are are clones."

"I also changed to code to:

If self touches anything turn red

They all were touching the numbers

 so they listened to that."

"I turned the indexes to invisibility 100

 but the circles are all turning red when it equals 1 even though they are not touching anything"

"You have to decrease the size of the circle more. Putting it at 20 will work better. The circle seems to bump each other when there is nothing

 it's not working.. this is really weird

Make a new project with like 3 or 2 circles so you can get the idea. Then add more circles"

[quote=""MR.GAM3R

 post:100

 topic:34438""]

###The Poisoned Drink Riddle

The King of a small country invites 1000 senators to his annual party. As a tradition

 each senator brings the King a bottle of drink. 

Soon after

 the Queen discovers that one of the senators is trying to assassinate the King by giving him a bottle of poisoned drink. 

Unfortunately

 they do not know which senator

 nor which bottle of drink is poisoned

 and the poison is completely indiscernible. 

However

 the King has 10 prisoners he plans to execute.

 He decides to use them as taste testers to determine which bottle of drink contains the poison. 

The poison when taken has no effect on the prisoner until exactly 24 hours later when the infected prisoner suddenly dies. 

The King needs to determine which bottle of drink is poisoned by tomorrow so that the festivities can continue as planned. 

Hence he only has time for one round of testing.

Hopscotch running super slow?

"This has happened to me before

 but it was on an older iPad with lots of code. I think it was a combanation of both when that happened. The movement speed slowed down by a fraction of 4

 I still love your lemonade stand video game!"

I can send you a couple of videos showing you the slowness when I get home. I bet it's the same thing. What kind of computer/iPad do you use?

 when I got a new iPad

 the code sped up by a lot. That's probably what is happening since the iPad Mini 2 has an A5 processor

 while the newer ones have an A10. Hopscotch used to only allow 512 clones

 and that made my old iPad haywire. Now that it's 4096 clones

 my iPad couldn't even run it. Now my new iPad can run it just fine. I think your code is great

 it's just to powerful for an iPad Mini 2.

 it's the clones that are killer

It's really weird too

 since iPad's are supposed to handle millions of clones and object running at once.."

"The only way for me was to get a new iPad. I had the exact same trouble as you:

Laggy clones

Typing in the code bars are slow

Projects take a while to run

It still sort of happens to me on the iPad I use now. It's pretty frustrating"

 that's great! Yeah

 I knew it was a bug in the code

 but I didn't know if THT was going to help it. Running things on Python or Scratch that are complex have no trouble running at all"

This especially happens when you have code written that does something when two objects collide.

I Don't Think We Need Topics About Releasing One Project/Is The OMTL Overused/Another Location Warning/Irrelevant Topics [Rants?] (T_T)

 here's a long reply:

I think some people agree with this and some people disagree with this. I think some people are annoyed that there are topics on the forum that are clogging the space and making things disorganized (like me). Other people think that it's perfectly ok and the Hopscotch Forum is here so that we can have friendships and do things together. Both of these ideas are perfectly fine

 it's just how you communitcate them that makes it not fine

I think this is a great post

 but just because one side of the forum believes that this isn't the best idea

 doesn't mean they should automatically flag it. They should respond by saying

 ""Why do you think that?"" And having a friendly discussion about it. 

Flags are here for a reason

 to hide someone's post that was innapropriate

 aggressively mean

 or personal information. We should not flag if someone is expressing an idea

 we should ask them why they think that way. 

-- Main Point -- If they respond rudely or innapropriately

 them you can flag. It's not fair to flag someone who's different than you. (I see this happened.. if someone is acting rudely

 you can just say it to them. If they don't recognize it

 just flag)

<sub> <sub> I agree

 the OMTL is overused

 but it's kind of our fault we put our name in it.."

 ok. Maybe they are busy or something? If they left

 I guess you don't need to worry about it

(Also by the way

 the topic about the clogging up the forum thing was probably a lot of misunderstanding. I did read the conversation that happened afterwards and saw that they was pretty rude to you.)"

Q and A with Paigey! [NEWEST]

"The answe to math strange math question was 5 apparently.

I've still gotta work it out"

I read your posts on the Reimann Hypothesis

 it helped me understand it a lot better! Also

 I have another question for you. I recently bought a book from the bookstore called Hyperspace by Michio Kaku. It is a great book all about Hyperspace

 higher dimensional math

 worm holes

 and Reimannian Geometry. I know about Euclidean Geometry

 but not that much about Reimannian Geometry (I'd think I'd have to finish reading the book to learn more). What do you know about Reimanniwn Geomtry?"

How to tap invisible things

 I used to do this

 it's very easy to do

 but makes the project very messy with objects all over the place

But

 there is an easier way to do it without anything visible at all

 if you were checking if an object passed a certain point

 you could say:

>When (  (object)  x position)  >  ( (Width) / 2 )

     - Change Y by 200

This code let's you have an object move across

 and when it gets past a certain point

 it moves upwards.

This is much easier than having a character bump a slightly infisible character and then move up

 like in this code: (object 2 is the 99% invisible character)

>When game starts

- Set (object 2) position to: (100

 (Width/2) )

- Set invisibility to 99%

>When (object) bumps (object 2)

- Change Y by 200

This code is much less efficient and makes your code more buggy. It is much easier for a character to check if it's at a certain X or Y position on a map

 and then do something

Hopefully this helped!"

##Ideas Currently Added

- Random Category

- How To's Category <sub> (Added with Open-Source Code)

##Ideas on how categories can be added

Long thought process dead ahead üòÖ

1. We brainstorm Category ideas until he have at least 10 really good ideas.We would submit the 10 really good ideas to you each month.

2. We would revise those ideas on your opinion

3. When ready

 we'd take a vote whether or not these ideas would be good. The voting polls would be:

‚Ä¢ All ideas are great

‚Ä¢ Most ideas are great

‚Ä¢ Half the ideas are great

‚Ä¢ 3 - 4 ideas are great

‚Ä¢ 2 ideas are great

‚Ä¢ 1 idea is great

‚Ä¢ None are really too great

If we get at least 25-50 people to hit at least 50% of the votes on ""all"" or ""most"" ideas are great

 then we could enter the voting stage (if it is lower

 then we'd move back to revisions and brainstorming)

We'd enter the voting stage and make a poll with all of the 10 category ideas. We would have a week of the voting period

 then the polls will close

4. Then the winning category idea would be turned into a new category

 and the process would restart again

We would also have to check with Hopscotch Team

 we might not get to do all ideas :blush:

**More thoughts:**

The time it should take for a new category to be added should be around 1 - 2 months or so.

**Depreciating categories**

If we reach to a certain number of categories

 we should have a vote on if a certain category is being unused.

This vote would determine if a category will be depreciated into the help with code

 or better yet have a depreciated category

 with depreciated sub-categories

(Is it possible to have categories within categories?)

Answer: Yeah

 just remembered. There are the ""Bugs in Player"" and ""Bugs in Editor"" sub-categories.

The depreciated category should have sub-categories

 so we can still have a basis of organization"

I just created the category idea topic and put it in meta

"That's pretty cool!

<kwjsjsja>"

 I thought it'd be nice if they were all put into one topic so it's more organized"

Would you like to add your ideas? I turned on the mass edit

Thanks! I was thinking it'd be a place where people could play games without being disruptive

@Ihasfluffycupcakes that's a great idea!!

"Great question!

There are infinitely many types of curved lines. Parabola graphs are in:

y = ax^2 + bx^1 + cx^0   =(which is simplified to)=   y = ax^2 + by + c

If you want higher grades of parabolas

 you can do:

y = ax^(n) + bx^(n - 1)  +  cx^(n - 2) ...  ...  yx^(2) + zx^(1) + wx^(0)

Exponential graphs are in:

y = 2^x

(And you can edit the 2 to any number to make it a higher grade)

Circles and ellipses are in:

1 =   (x - h)/(a^2)  +  (y - k)/(b^2)

""h"" is for horizontal movement

""k"" is for kait movement which is vertical

If a = b

"I read up more about Reimannian Geometry! Hooray!

 on a flat surface

 the sum of every single triangle's angles will always add up to 180¬∞. On a globe-like surface

 the angles will add up to greater than 180¬∞

 and on an inverted globe-like surface

 it'll add up to less than 180¬∞. 

 your answer to the summation of the reversal of all the prime numbers is correct. It diverges to infinity (If a summation reaches to more than 2

 it will always diverge to infinity). Surprisingly

 the sum of the reversal of all the prime numbers is used in the Reimann Hypothesis.

Euler did reaserch on this and was the first to recognize it. Reimann also studied this and found that prime numbers held a relationship with his Zeta Function.

Since the only one prime ends in a 5

 which is 5

 there are no other primes less than 100

 except for the ones from 50 - 59. 53 and 59 happen to be prime.

So.. 53 + 59 + 5 = 117

 it does not diverge to infinity

(Oh! I forgot I made this! It was such a long time ago)

Too bad I can't move this to the math topic anymore

[details=Detailed Proof]

Yes! I love this! I had showed how to do that to my math teacher and class

 but they all got very upset at me. My math teacher said that it was on a curved surface

 so it didn't count. Little did I know about Reimannian Geometry which is all about curved surfaces!

I gave then a second proof. If you have 2 parallel lines on a graph

 they can still reach each other at infinity. What I mean is that they are at an infinitesimally small angle

 so that they will never be any closer to each other (until they reach infinity). We can prove this with this mind bending stantement:

Does 0.999.. = 1?

1/3 = 0.333..

3(1/3) = 3(0.333..)

3/3 = 0.999..

And we know that 3/3 = 1

 so..

1 = 0.999..

So now 0.000..1 = 0. A line having that angle will never move until it reaches infinity.

Who can make a triangle who's angles add up to less than 180¬∞?

Factorials are an interesting thing. 10! Would be 1*2*3...8*9*10.

Factorials have Name divisors

 hence also being called antiprimes or extremely composite numbers

1000! Have a good plenty amount of divisors. We will branch all of the numbers multiplied together into their factors. Then we'll have a perfect factor.

4 = 2

 2

6 = 2

9 = 3

10 = 2

12 = 2

14 = 2

 7

I don't want to flag him or something because I might have misunderstood what he said"

"Yeah. Also

 he's a he. I read his first/second post from Oct. 16 saying he's a boy

 I think he's just gonna ignore us. Next post and I'm just gonna flag"

"In the words of Liza and THT

 please talk to people on the forum as if they were the same level of intelligence as you. Just because you're smarter than someone doesn't meant that you can be mean and rude."

"Look

 we are not mad at you or anything

 we just want you to be nice. As seen form an earlier post

 it seems you have been bullied at school. I understand that. But it doesn't mean you can let it out on other people

 I knew it. It was a misunderstanding

 we were getting a little suspicious. Our bad

 that was a little awkward

 it still seemed ihaveexpectations was making a rude comment"

"Much more accurate than my answer of -83.447!

 Greta job! That's a very though one"

"Ok! Sounds good! (You should do a math blog as well

 that'd be really cool!)"

"Sure! I'll add that to my list of blog posts I'll do!

I'm actually not in trig

 but am learning it over the summer

 so I might write an overview or something fun"

Idea.... for The Drawing Topics

"I haven't put anything/been apart of the drawing topic in a long time

 so I'm not actually sure I should vote. But

 it's a good idea (how much time is there in between drawing topic eras? That might change my vote)

While we are on this

 there should be a Hopscotch collage for the best of the best artworks made by different people. Where everyone can post once on the topic and put their best piece of artwork they'd like to show off

 then we could have an art show or something"

 ok. Yeah

 there should be something like this so they don't create a new topic completely for their couple pieces of artwork. It's just that if a drawing topic is used for a while

 people may forget about this idea. It's a good idea

 but it might be forgotten."

You should try it and see how it works

I'm gonna bookmark your answer for further use :)

Game Changers Topic

"Good luck! Here's some adivce!

Why do the tubes start before the bird flaps. Is that meant to happen?

 you should make a variable for the bird falling down

 @Funky_63_Greenland did a project representation on that. I think it'd be really cool and it also helped me with my code

"I got overwhelmed with school and making questions. I might host it over the summer

 and would also like help making questions"

Umm... please no flags

"I think

 if you feel like you should take a break

 that might be good. Just recooperate and relax. If you want to stay on

 that's great too. I think people aren't treating you very nicely which is why flame wars can take place. We all need to be kind to people as if you were talking to them.

Jealousy part

 there's a nominations for featured topic for a reason. If you feel like you worked hard on a project

 put it there. Liza will give you recognition. 

 just take off the poll. It will only make you feel worse. 

We really don't want people to leave the forum. We want to have a fun time and enjoy sharing ideas and being creative. I really hope this helped"

Some ideas on Artificial Intelligence

"Yes! I love artificial intelligence! I think this could also be in the math category as well. My dad's company works on AI

 and wow it's amazing. AI is like magical mathematics and I love it

More on my dad's company:

AYASDI is a pretty cool place. They create topology maps along with artificial intelligence. Their main focus is on healthcare and making it more efficient.. (editing more things

 I've got a Bio test..)"

"[details=Hey

 Ihaveexpectations  this is for you.] 

 what you posted here makes me mad. Here's what I'm gonna say:

Look

 I honestly don't care whether you know calculus

 or are learning in second grade. I don't care at all. I don't care what level math you are

 but I do care how you treat other people. Just because you feel like your better than someone or have a prejudice still doesn't mean you can blow up in their face and tell them they aren't smart. That's not how it works. Also

 every person who has autism that I know are all extreeeemely smart. So what you said doesn't make sense

 it is plain mean. If you feel like you can target a specific group of people or be rude and obnoxious

 this forum isn't for you. If you want to stay

 just get along with people. Make friends and talk about math. It makes everyone a lot happier and is honestly more fun. Don't waste your time on things that don't matter

 you should be smarter than that

 you said so yourself. If your extremely smart and can solve famous math problems

 but don't care about people and are rude

 nobody will care that your smart they'll care about how you treat people.

 kind of got off on a rant there. But it's true. You need to be kind to people whether or not your smarter than them.

Last last last last last

 being mean to people just because they have autism or whatever is a veeeery important topic to me right now. My younger brother is dealing with things of the like

 but it doesn't make him unsmart. In fact

 on an IQ test that went to 180

 he scored a perfect 180. He's wicked smart

 but he still has some issues he needs help with. But barely any of it is math. Ok I'm done.

Here was mine:

[details=here]

[details=Here was BAS's:]

Math isn't a competition. When you say things like that

 you don't come off as intelligent

 but simply very snarky. Everyone is at a different level here mathematically

 but the thing about math is that it isn't about what you know. I don't care if you've learned functions

 or can apply the binomial theorem

 or know a lot of lambda calculus. It doesn't make you a good mathematician. What makes a good mathematician is problem solving skill - and that is why people were able to connect on this topic at drastically different levels of skill.

Discouraging that is a very bad thing.

 yeah it does

Unleash the beast!

He he"

Think we should just create a separate topic so my Numberphile Topic doesn't get flagged down?

We are resolving this: back to resolving again: RESOLVED

 I don't know what's going on

 but you've been acting very unkindly on the forum lately. I just wanted to create a formula topic for this because I want to resolve what's happening. I noticed that you said that you had wanted to make people with autism feel bad

 which I greatly disagree on. I would like to work this out

 and become friends since I know that your extremely smart in math. I don't want to have a flag war or anything

 but peacefully resolve this. Thank you

 Desmos is pretty awesome. I think it doesn't matter if it's either positive or negative

 but the answer is very interesting (I think either x is prime or both x and y solutions are prime. Something like that). I must admit

 I found this problem in a prime numbers book (sorry. Didn't make it). It's veeery tough and spits out some large answers. If you want to be super awesome and actually solve it

 I would be blown away.

some lifetime of traditional handed-out textbook questions

I agree. Common core is killer. I'd like it if there was a math group or something for people who love math and science

 to just completely excel at their own pace and have fun with it. This would produce much more people in science and math fields who can change the world"

 I'm sorry about that. Home/un schooling is becoming more and more popular because of this (you should really try persuade your parents about the benefits of it and how you would be able to really excel). 

And.. my iPad battery is about to die so I'll be back in a bit.

 the forum has told me that I've been posting a lot lately as well :smile:

That's the Joy in maths. You can go into different areas

 and have a lot of fun (I also love drawing myself and do mazes from time to time :) ) <sub> actually

 I was really into them until High School made it too busy for me to work on them. Homeschooling just sounds better and better"

 I've been watching vsauce as well. I've recently gotten very addicted into it

 thanks to t1

 no

 it's not Aleph-null or any infinite number

 but good guess! (One of the answers happen to be prime!)"

 sorry. Not that one either"

"Your welcome and thank you at the same time!

<sub> Yeah

 I think homeschooling and the such can easily cause a lot of rants

 I've done it myself (I feel like I'm missing out on things as well

 like not going off to my full potential in this area) but here I go on a rant again!

I'm gonna look into the maze generator website in a bit (bio homework..). It looks really awesome and can't wait to check it out further! (I've actually wanted to do something of the like for a programming project or something).

I'm also really happy your enjoying my problems

 math is fun to think about when you're bored in class (and ironically for me

 in actual math class!). I have a friend who gives me math questions as well that are fun to do in spare time :)"

"How about at the top 2 corners

 you create a line down to the bottom. Then you have 2 right triangles surrounding a square or rectangle. That might be something.."

"Oh snap! I was so excited I forgot to give a reference unit! How about each graph square is a unit. I'll edit that in

Ooh! I can't wait to look into Edgy! <sub> (mazes are like my second favorite thing to do!)

Bye!"

"Oh! You're talking about a right trapezoid. Sorry

 I was mistaken. That looks like a pretty good proof to me

 I think you'll be good"

Thanks! I guess it just goes to show how simple designs can be difficult to solve. I'm still wondering how to solve it. Probably using the distance forumula.

"I don't know. I'm getting a very sleepy brain too (it's only 9!). I'll have to sleep on it and work tomorrow. It sounds as though that your getting somewhere and on the right track. In the meantime

 I've got school work in need to finish.. ugh.."

Thanks! Sounds good. Bye

"When you come back to the forum with 17 notifications üòêüòë

It'll take a while for me to read.."

 mazes connect a lot with graph theory and topology.

I had never thought about splitting up a maze like that! It's very interesting like it's simplifying the whole thing down to a graph set!"

 I quickly ran out of flags as well. I contacted Liza about this so hopefully we might be getting some mods soon"

"Wow! Incredible work!

I know that the upper bound is 50 and the lower bound is 16. I'm gonna have a go at this during school

 I'll see what I get! :)"

 the book doesn't have the raunchiness in it

(I was quiet sad when I figured out the online did have it though

 because I was excited to tell my parents about this new science resource. Little did I know about xkcd at that point and my parents told me not to use the site)"

We should probably create a topic specifically for types of maths used (for example the FRACTAN and other types of topics like Reimannian Geometry or Flexagons). It would be awesome if people added their ideas and tools for specific ideas instead of needing to separate topics for ideas that not many people know about.

"The Golden ratio blog post:

By @t1_hopscotch ‚Äì and @JonnyGamer (you can just add to this like normal whenever like it is yours too! :D)

- The Golden Ratio is equal to `(1 + ‚àö5)/2 : 1` 

 which is approximately `1.618... : 1`. The number is also known as phi Œ¶

 a letter of the Greek alphabet (like how pi œÄ is also a letter of the Greek alphabet

 and phi rhymes with pi).

 - (it's a matter of opinion)

 but shapes using the Golden Ratio for measurements are thought to be aesthetically pleasing

 hence the name. e.g. a rectangle with its side lengths in the Golden Ratio

 with the longer side 1.618 in comparison to the shorter side is known as a golden rectangle.

- If you take any two consequential Fibonacci numbers and divide the smaller one into the larger one

 as the Fibonacci numbers grow larger

 it will get closer and closer to the golden ratio!

![|666x500](upload://6p98Ew2CIPopZ1eWleY2JGCzBBp.PNG)

- if you add 1 to phi you get its square

 and if you subtract 1 from phi you get its reciprocal (recipocral is when you divide 1 by a number)

"This has to do with triangle

 numbers! Awesome!

[details=All about triangle numbers]

This is a great question

 and has to do a lot with triangle numbers!

First

 I'll explain what they are: a triangle number is like a factorial (n!)

 but instead of multpliyong together all the previous numbers

 you add them together.

There's a formula for finding triangular numbers

 which is derived form the patter of 1

 1 + 2

 1 + 2 + 3

 ...

It follows a right triangle using dots (I'll provide a link for this!)

n * ( n + 1 )

  ‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì

       2

Now that we are talking about it

 this is why square numbers are called square! It makes a square pattern when you increase which gives you the formula:

n*n

Also! A square number can be trianglular! Can you find any examples?? :slight_smile:

 there are numbers such as pentagonal

 hexagonal

 septagonal

 ... 

 myriagonal!

Here's links to these that explain them better:

Hope this helped! This stuff is great!

"Yes there's a lot of controversy. I'd like to see what you're views are on this! But here's my view:

A reason I think we should bear arms

 is that if we do happen to ban guns

 the people who are going to not follow the rules

 still won't follow the rules and smuggle/steal guns. Just because there's a new law saying they can't use guns

 and they don't follow the laws anyway

 they're not going to follow this one either

[details=OMTL]

 this topic was *not* my idea. But @PopTart0219 left and people are using outdated OMTLs. I believe I got an updated version.

#GUIDELINES:

**Do not overuse** - Use it once per subject

 and *only use it in general topics* ***for new projects***.(only once a month for gen topics)

**Use it in the post you want people to see** - Nobody likes scrolling. Well

 some people do.

**Only use it for things you can contribute to** - Something something don't tag for smol potatoes.

**Put it in a details folder** - Put an empty line before the details folder.

**Keep the count going** - Increase the count when you add yourself

 decrease it when you remove yourself.

**Don't tamper with the list** - It's annoying when someone messes it up. 

**Keep the list in alphabetical order** - This is a semi new tradition

 making it easier to remove yourself.

**Remove yourself if you leave** There is a limit of 150 tags

 so remove yourself so you don't waste tags

I missed a lot of guidelines

 I think

 so please put in any you can remember.

"Did @UnderagedCoder1 add his email to his account? That's the only way anyone could've changed a password. (When you create the account

 you add your email. It's optional

 though)

To change the password

 you need an email. Whoever changed the pass must've known UnderAgedCoder's email (if he put any..). But if he didn't attatch an email to the account

 no one could ever change the pass

But if he did attatch an email

 the only person who could've changed the pass would be him

 or a hacker who logged into his email (He said he didn't change the pass

 so it must've been a hacker)

This is a very strange situation..

Email THT right away to ask them what the password is

 or just say ""I forgot my password"" when logging in so that you can reset it using your email

This is post number 228

"The ""Start"" Title doesn't disappear when the game starts or when you click ""How to Play"". It does dissapewr when you tap the credits

 though. I'll check the code.

 ""How to Play"" showed up when I died"

"You don't need a bunch of Repear Forever's in the ""7 = 7"" Whens.

The 7 = 7 means repeat forever

 also you can just add variables in there so it could be..

When Start = 1

Set Invisibility to 100%

When Start = 0

Set Invisibility to 0%

It might just be all the repeat forevers"

"Hmm.. we might need to rewrite the code..

So when Start = 0

 all of the things should be visible..

But surround these with check's if the How = 1 and the Cred = 1"

"You should make something to collect

 like space coins or something.

 you should have limited power

 so collecting space coins will give you more power or help you buy more power.

The game is great

 and adding  little bit more to it would make it incredible!"

"I will definitely join

"What do you think the numbers mean?

I'm assuming it's the later because theres a little ""‚Äì"" mark so that must be backwards as well"

"It's in quinary

"So since the signature seems backwards as well since

1101 00110 **0**3422024202

1. We brainstorm Category ideas until he have at least 10 really good ideas. We would submit the 10 really good ideas to you each month.

4. If we get at least 25-50 people to hit at least 50% of the votes on ""all"" or ""most"" ideas are great

5. We'd enter the voting stage and make a poll with all of the 10 category ideas. We would have a week of the voting period

6. Then the winning category idea would be turned into a new category

More thoughts:

The time it should take for a new category to be added should be around 1 - 2 months or so. 

Depreciating categories

 we should have a vote on if a certain category is being unused.

"**More about terms**

Writing a function can have infinitely many terms:

But let's start with just the first term

 which is the constant

If 5 were out only term

 it's just like saying: 5 * (x^0)

To simplify that to 5:

1. we take (x^0) = 1 (anything to the power of zero is 1)

2. 5 * 1 = 5

If we have 2 terms

 for example:

5x + 5

That's exactly like saying:

5(x^1) + 5(x^0)

As you can see

 the more terms we add

 the more the ""powered"" values on the ""x"" go up.

That's just the basics of terms

 I'll type more on this

Haha! ThNks so much! (Yes! Tau is better üòÇ)

What made you stick with Hopscotch?

 this is an amazing idea!!!!

**Here's my Hopscotch History:**

About my dad:

This all starts with my dad

 around 15 he really wanted to learn how to code video games. He had got to the mall arcades and wanted to copy and invent some creations of his own! He spent a lot of time reading programming manuels and his dad bought him a computer. He made top selling games like MacGolf (which was the first 3D game on the Mac and was the top selling game for 5 years!). He's worked at many programming companies like Adobe (invented the history pallets for photoshop)

 Microsoft

 and Apple. But now he has settled down at an epic Artificial Intelligence start up called AYASDI whose main focus is on improving health care and securing bank transactions.

How my dad introduced me to coding:

Once my dad heard a few years ago that I had passed all of the Hour of Code challenges (there weren't too many back then.. üòÇ)

 he decided to show me this great new app called Hopscotch! This was in August 2014 (or 2013!) and the Holloween Update was there so all the characters were dressed up in Halloween costumes (I didn't know why

 though. It was very confusing at the time). Once he showed me the app

 he created mini programming challenges for me which I would do (One of them was to create a spiral

 but I hadn't grasped the concept of Variables at the time

 so I peeked at his code üòÇ). A little while later

 Hopscotch created the Community

 which was very basic to what we have now. There was the newest section and most liked section (I think something else too..). They had finally created profiles and I could ""Star"" other people's projects as well. Seeing amazing projects made by the community and  sing inspired

I decided that Hopscotch was an amazing place for me to stay on (Funky63 and T1's projects were epic).

My first Collab:

After some time of doodling around (and a failed attempt to make a Space Invaders game without knowing how to use Variables and without ""When"" Blocks for bumping)

 my friends and I

 who were in 6th grade at the time

 decided to create a Flappybird Gamecenter Arcade (This was like 3-4 years ago)

This idea eventually lead to my first featured project

Learning how to use Variables:

One of my friends finally helped me learn how to use variables

 and they did that by creating a simple button joystick. At the time

 if you were editing a certain character

 you couldn't make it move when a different character was tapped. When the other character was tapped

 set a variable to 1. When the variable is 1

 the original character moves a certain direction and sets the variable back to 0. This is how we had to make joysticks

Progression:

Once I learned variables

 I went into creating an idea called ""Flip it"" later called ""Gravity Cube"". I'll add all of my updates below.. or you can find them down near the bottom of my profile in Hopscotch. I had unknowingly based this off of the AppStore game called Gravoty Duck (it's an amazing game!). After a few more tests

 the community had a ""How To's"" section! When I published this project

 it was put on there right next to the ""How to get the emoji keyboard"" project (maybe by Kiwicute??). I was extremely proud of this moment and was the main reason I have stayed since then. That project got 350 likes or something

Experimenting:

Once I had gotten to Update 1.7

 the character moves way too fast! This is because I was using an iPad 3 at the time and my code had become really laggy. I sped up the movement to make it less slow

 but on newer iPad's it because waaaay to fast).

 these are not the same rectangle characters that Hopscotch used now. I hand picked them using Unicode characters

 when sounds was added

 I tried doing it with sounds

 but utterly failed and gave up üòÇ)

I also experimented with some update ideas

Coding Phase:

After experimenting for some weeks

 I decided to enter a coding phase. This was my most proud time

 which was where I created loads of ideas and also had a bunch of time on my hands.

Features in during this time:

Music:

I then got into creating music for people. I entered @MagmaPOP's 3D Minecraft competition for music! I had created a song

 but it was too long.. üòÇ

After I made this last song

 Funky63 got really upset at the Community and deleted all of his projects.. It was a dark period for me since my main inspired left. He did eventually return

After I made this game called

 ""Radius""

 I went into an inactive spurt on my own account. That's because I went to a new account called Quantum9! I also joined my first collab called ""Anime Art"" (Hosted by @Hermione) . I drew some pictures there that I was really proud of. They got deleted though

 by a hacker.. One got liked by MagmaPOP

 though!!

Pictures:

![|111x100](upload://vQERvI2tJN7bWVSAn6vv4CLtfWe.png)![|111x100](upload://iqzqVLhRMIiT3E2PIceGfW98dmJ.png)

Quantum9 was an account I created just for mathematical tests

 and basically the account I used to learn Sin and Cosine. I made a few awesome projects over there

 feel free to check them out! (I'll add more about this)

Eventually

 8th grade had arrived (last year) and I had to turn in my iPad. I made a goodbye project and I felt really bad for leaving Hopscotch. I could code

 on a different iPad 3

 but it was extremely slow. My Dad thankfully bought me a new iPad at the beginning of summer for High School

 but I was still very inactive. Not until the start of this summer did I become active again. I created a new account called ""Super Mario Mini Games"". I made this account with my younger brother and also got the subscription. We made a few featured projects on there

 but I have become inactive again (except I am making a few secret projects.. üòè). I have become extremely active on the forum and finally have gotten Regular! Yay! I do think

 that I will graduate Hopscotch soon and will design apps using JavaScript and Python. I will however always stay on the forum and talk about math! Thanks for reading

Longest autobiography ever.

This is still incomplete

 so I'll be adding some more stuff. This I should still a pin pick of my life in the past 4 years

"I'm reviving this topic because.. 6/28 is Tau Day!

Tau is exactly 2*pi

This is important because a circle is 2*pi Radians

Engineers use Tau because it's more efficient to say half a circle is Tau/2 instead of Pi/4"

"e^(i * pi) = -1

Euler's amazing special formula! üòÉ

 I've never hear dog the other one with Tau! I'll look it up!

I check Wolfram Alpha and it came up with some interesting Calculus derivative I do not understand yet. Doing more research

Absolute value of (e ^ ( i * Pi) ) = 1

Edit! You were right! Worlram thought that the Tau symbol was a variable for unknown reasons.. Wow! That's really awesome!

So when you multiply ""pi"" by even numbers

 the result of the equation is ""1""

 the result is ""-1""

"Hm... hm... hmm... hmmmm...

 it gave you some numbers and letters. That's hexadecimal code

 so I put it in again. The hacker said he encrypted it a couple of times"

Yes! I think you are right! Let's decode!

That is my riddle account

 UPDATE-

Basically

 using this hint and

CielingFan hotdog no space I.E. switch

CielingFan hotdog I.E. replacement

Her account is CielingFan. There are two hackers who hacked

 the lead hacker who once was Enigma/Snake of Ice

 which changed her name to Oribi Jaguar Blue Winfx and the second hacker

 who's alias used to be Mysterious Queen

 and whose current alias is Shadowslayer. There is also a third new apprentice

 whose current alias is Pidgeypodged

 aka MistyMystery. Misty is @HappyDolphin and trains 2 apprentices

 Frog Space and FidgetFish. 

The hackers host the trials on the CielingFan account. We finished them. Now Oribi Jaguar Blue Winfx is the head of Hopscotch Hacker Association (HHA). FrogSpace

 Snoo

 and Soapysuds are also in the HHA. 

We don't know much of OribiJaguarBlueWinfx. All that we know is that she hacked several collabs and personal accounts

 left HS

 and is very smart. She apparently likes ""Daytripper""

 by the Beatles. And she plays the guitar. She's also a friend of FearlessPhoenix

 and is possibly the creator of her fan account. Oribi has gotten several features

 you're fine

 the silly hacker made us go on for hours to find something we knew already üòÖ That's annoying"

Is there any other hints or was that it?

 it's probably an extra something from a different conversion since she had multiple conversions in one text"

 I am the Universal Drift. I have noticed a disturbance in the Dark Energy that envelopes the universe. Evil is drawing closer

 and will do anything it can to end the universe. You are the only ones who can stop the evil from spreading and destroying existence. I have special secret messages I have obtained

 perhaps it can help you

 the are heavily encrypted. Are you smart enough to crack them

 solve the puzzle

 and save the universe?

[details=What's this all about?]

So basically

 this is just for fun decryption and stuff. You will need to go to a lot of places (maybe even the app itself!) to find clues. Can you be the first to save the universe?

"We are making a secret PM really soon

 sorry"

I got spam liked! It means war!

"Tilting has nothing to do with whether it's AR or VR

AR is augmented

 which means you are seeing the actual world

 with stuff added on it (makes you less dizzy üòÖ)

VR is virtual

 it's a completely virtual world

"Pretty good! How about you?

Doing a math game thingy fun stuff"

"Ooh! Awesome!

You should have different scenery pop up like tunnels or something. I made a project a while ago on that.. grabbing think..

<makamamak>"

 I think it'll get featured. You should make a game out of it

 too. No one has even done that

 that would be definitely feature worhty"

<mamamamamxmeocoekak>"

"Great! This is going to be really cool

 and very difficult. It's like a search and find as well so sometimes you might need to find a clue in someone's Hopscotch account sometimes! (Or one I just created for the game)"

Yes!! That'll be awesome! Definitely feature worthy!!

"I don't even know üòÇ Sometime soon

 wait. I didn't even join the POMTL

 then I realized you used the OMTL first. POMTL was a great idea"

 the second version. It's great!"

The darkening background and then there's a sudden flash of light for a split split split second. It's pretty awesome!

Did you see the lightning?

 for games that'd be really good lowered down. If it were a game

 instead of a black background

 do a cool mountainous background or something

For just the 3d effect

 I like it how it is"

3d effects are awesome

Yeah! that would be the best!

'TheHacker' account

 I was going to do a cool decrypting competition idea

 but then I realized I worded it (very) strangely

 so then I decided to do it on my account. I'm really sorry!

 the hacking lately is really bad. It's extremely rude

 mean

 and annoying.

Also.. the person hacking the ScotchHop account had been reading our convo. Is there any way to track the IP addresses of people who've been reading a topic?"

"What's going on with the ScotchHop Team hacker situation? Anything new?

So the qwerty thing was actually a hint? That's actually weird"

Hmm

 this hacker issue is very difficult.. They only way I could figure out who it might be is to watch the OMTL list and see who's seen ""just now""

Since the hacker was reading our post

 they must be

 ""seen just now"" unless they don't have an account which would be horrible"

Thanks! @UnderagedCoder1 created it and we really need to fix it. The ScotchHop Team was one of his big accomplishments and it'd be sad to end it

How is HS doing?

"You left like a week ago. Everything is about the same! And yes

 the sundae was delicious! üòã How about you?

<sub> What! I thought I posted this post 8 days ago! Whaaaat! How'd it save?"

"Yeah sure! We are still trying to figure out who the hacker is and how to stop it

 so once we settle that we are going to create a PM and share the passwords"

"Nothing much! Drawing a maze for my brother's birthday

 how about you?"

"Woah! A production! Nice!

 let's chat in a general"

 @Hermione!

What kind of production are you doing? It's sounds awesome!"

 sorry about that. It's pretty annoying üòÖ <sub> silly hacker go back to 2015"

"Cool! Good bye!

<jamammdmskxkdkll>"

Yeah! Subway Surfers would be great! Or temple run!

"Apparently not üòÖ

Can you send it to me

 please? Thanks"

 I'm still signed on to the account

 so I don't need it right away

If I happen to log off

 then I'll need the password. I don't think the hacker has logged off yet.. ugh"

 ok. I got spam liked a couple of times so.. here it go!

How many days ago was it created? That'd be helpful. Thanks!"

"Here is some real augmented reality coming to iOS11!!!!!!

"3D projection Wikipedia that COAN showed me

"Snap! Wrong post

 sorry for alerting you t1 and HopscotchRemixer

The hacker said post 151 holds the answer.. and that is my post

Qwerty was a hint apparently"

 that is actually really strange. Why would qwerty have a decryption key? It's literally just typing straight across the keyboard.. unless that's their forum/hops account"

 maybe. That sounds like it'd work"

Gridify Pixel Arts?

"Do you have a friend Tag List? That'd be good to make one (I don't want you to get flagged)

Did you make that? It looks great!"

"I honestly have no idea since ""qwerty"" doesn't even make sense as a decryption key"

"Ooh! A picture! Oh! I think I know what you are talking about! A = Q

 B = W

 C = E

 D = R.. etc following the keyboard?"

Woah! You decoded that! No way!

"@ScotchHopTeam

Gobli cracked the code!!!!!!!"

"Woah. I can't believe you actually figured it out

 wow!"

The only avatar with the hotdog is Mielesgames but they've been inactive for 64 weeks.. hmm

No messages yet.. I'm sure they'll be one soon though since you figured it out

"Sounds good

 I still don't really understand how you did it

 but it was amazing"

"Oh my goodness

 we have a master decrypted over here! Wow! Incredible!"

 that'd be amazing.

<jsmsmsjsksk>"

<jejdjdjssjaakakakaksjj>"

Mieli is a girls name so I'd assume the account would be Mieli or something

Yes of course! We need all the help we can get!

4D monkey dust! Time to create a 4D sandbox in Hopscotch! If not let's create a quantum computer

"But Mieli is an actual girls name. They said that they were a girl

 so maybe it's another code

 maybe not"

"Hmm.. dishwashers..

I found mieligames except it was an abandoned profile (latest project 64 weeks ago)"

"Nice! Pretty cool!

<jajajsjsjssjjajajj>"

No! I knew it! Those sneaky dishwashers! <sub> Not again! XD

Hmm.. maybe so.. That'd be really tricky!

Yeah! 174 posts! Nice!

"T1 was trying to help us

 we changed the pass but the hacker won't leave the account"

That's definitely ceaser cipher

Yeah! Definitely! Another active one is the ScotchHop Team: Fixing the Hacker Issue

"The ceaser cipher shift decryption. It'd like A = B

 B = C

 C = D

And if that doesn't make anything

 shift it down again"

 not yet! Very soon though! Super Mario Odyssey! Mario + Rabbids Kingdom rush!"

"See ya! Hey

 I got a church vbs helping thing in 20 minutes!"

3? What do you mean?

"I can't wait for those games! They look pretty good

E3 was spectacular"

"That's awesome!

I'm on the praise team and they give us like yellow shirts to wear and a handkerchief. My church uses the Group vbs so this year's theme is galactic starveyors. We have cool handkerchiefs"

"VBS's are awesome!

 I'm not getting those games either. My brother will get splatoons

 though (why does he like it?..)

How's AMRS?"

I don't think I said anything about 3.. I might've mistyped something then

 exactly

You can move this topic into the other sin/cos topics"

Making a new ScotchHop Team account as a solution to hacking?

"Wow! Sounds awesome!

Does it say we remixed then on new accounts? Also

 can people still follow us or does that need to start over and need to tell them we switched accounts?

I heard about this idea

 I guess it could all be solved if Hopscotch made a way to log everyone out of the account. This would work when everyone is on WiFi and just be ejected from the account"

 yeah. Now I'm really tired from yesterday

Game Changers: How could it be changed

"Game Changers: How could *it* be Changed

**Statistics about Game Changers:**

<sub> For our purposes

 I will also be including Funky63‚Äôs deleted project

Age of Projects:

98% of projects on Game Changers were made over a year ago (57/58)

38% of projects on Game Changers were made over 2 years ago (22/58)

66% of projects on Game Changers will be made over 2 years ago in the next 10 weeks (38/58)

Project Creators:

46% of projects were made by 10 creators (28/58)

54% of projects were made by individual creators (39/58)

Hopscotch Updates Used:

1% of projects use the image update (1/58)

38% of projects use the sound update (22/58)

[details=Commentary]

It seems as though that the Game Changers List are made up of very old projects. This is not bad

 as Game Changers are the projects that inspire us

 but there haven't been any newly ‚Äúinspiring‚Äù projects or creators. Also

 most projects do not use ‚Äúnew‚Äù updates like the sound and image updates. Should the Hopscotch Team add more to this list? Or should there be a different idea for this..

One idea is the ‚ÄúBest project of the month‚Äù

This would be a list of Hopscotch‚Äôs favorite project made within a month. This helps new projects to be recognized more often.

Another idea related to this is ‚ÄúBest creators (of the month)‚Äù

This would show the top 10 creators of the month

 and how it would work is a ‚ÄúLikes to Project‚Äù ratio. This means that

 if a creator has created a lot of projects that have a lot of likes

 they'd be on the top 10 list. If one person seems to be dominating the list

 they could be put in the ‚ÄúHall of Fame‚Äù which would show the best creators and also best projects that have been made (so combined with the Game Changers section)

Although these are closely related to ‚ÄúFeatured‚Äù and ‚ÄúTrending‚Äù

 these may be able to take the place of them as a better alternative. But we would still be able to keep sections like ‚ÄúRising‚Äù and ‚ÄúStarter projects‚Äù

One last thing: 

We should bring back the How-To‚Äôs section (Start Projects seems to be pretty good

We should create an art section: All popular projects underneath the ‚Äúart‚Äù section would be put in a ‚Äúbest art‚Äù category. The same could go for other sections like a ‚Äúbest game‚Äù or ‚Äúbest idea‚Äù or ‚Äúbest challenge‚Äù or ‚Äúbest movie‚Äù etc.

**Summing everything up:**

‚ÄúBest Projects of the Month‚Äù section

‚ÄúTop Ten Creators‚Äù section

‚ÄúHall of Fame‚Äù section

‚ÄúBest: ‚Äò___‚Äô‚Äù section <sub> (Best Artwork

 best game

He changed his name saying that he left as well. (I also wrote him a little note üòÇ He probably didn't read it)

@PIANOMAN"

People were making fun of him and over reacting to things he was saying. He was trying to prevent chatrooms/copying projects/meanness but he said it in a way that some people took offensively.

"t1 is technically an adult

 she turned 18 a few weeks ago

Funky63 was born in 1963. That's all the Hospcthers I know who are adults"

I think we should just give up. We are transferring all the projects to a new account sometime soon

Probably MagmaPOP or Funky63.. maaaybe someone else might but idk

 I just saw it. Yeah

 hopefully it will be as popular as it once was"

 true true true.  But it might not even give away anything at all or if real importance. It'd be fun to make one up ourselves"

"Let's count all of MagmaPOP's. MagmaPOP said he lost track after 15

 so he potentially could have more"

There really needs to be an update idea category. That'd be great

"Meta is anything self referential. In this case

 update ideas and how things can be improved

Hey! That means we don't need an update idea category! Yes!

"Pretty much. Since Gamer Changers hasn't been updated in forever and 

doesn't really cover much.

Thanks! I've been thinking about this for a while"

 probably.. maybe..

That's why if people are dominating

 they'd just be moved to the hall of fame section so that they don't take up space"

So that means whatever it is might be related to something!

Mod FAQ's [OFFICIAL TOPIC]

"[quote=""SilverSong

 topic:36296""]

at least 18

Ooh! 3 more years! Sooo clooose

<sub> Being a Hopscotch Mod might actually be really fun! I've been considering it a lot"

"**Wow! Thanks for taking the time of writing all of that out! It really means a lot!**

Here are some more ideas about this:

**Competition:**

 I've realized a lot of this could potentially add a lot of competition. Maybe if there was a way to somehow change the perspective on that by showing off individual Hopscotchers. I noticed that half of the Game Changers projects were made by 10 Hopscotchers

 and the other half were all individually made. If there was a way to feature individual stuff

 that'd be great. So once you're recognized on it

 then your done and other people have a chance at being recognized.

Another thing is people's talent and/or exposure. For talent (back to the Game Changers) a lot of them were made by really talented people (Which they deserve to be recognized for

 because their projects are great). If there was a way in which less talented people could get more exposure to their code

 that'd be great. The Rising section was a perfect idea

 except THT started using it less and instead used the Featured section. I've noticed that a few projects were put on the Rising list

 that's great.

**Remodeling the Featured List:**

Since ""Feature worthy"" projects and ""Rising worthy"" projects have been intermingled in the ""Featured"" tab

 I was thinking about making an improved version of it. I'm still brainstorming ideas about this

If Hopscotch put up they're favorite project of the month

 this would drive people to create something or invent something and spend a lot of time doing so. Maybe even they could do their ""Top 10"" or ""Highlights"" of the month

 but it would drive a lot of healthy competition (People would have motive to create something really high quality)

 due to something like THT not seeing someone's project

 it could be a real downer. If there were specific people looking out for projects like this

 that'd be great. But it would be hard to find people willing to do that.

I remember back when the Community started

 all of the projects I saw were amazing and people spent a lot of time creating them. There were no chat rooms or spam projects

 it was all high quality things people were proud to have published (The texting update idea seems pretty good to implement because of this

 but it might take a while to create something like that. Maybe only people with subscription can text

 but then the majority of people who don't might still create spam projects.. this is tough!)

Woah! I didn't realize how long this got. I am definitely going to add more to this

 topic:36461""]

Just to add in advance

 Hopscotch may not be able to implement suggestions either.

 I really hope their company grows. How many people work there? I think Hopscotch is an amazing idea and definitely helps people learn how to code and be imaginative"

 there really needs to be a way to filter out chat rooms and the like. How about after a day or so

 without any likes (or 1) they become invisible and only can been seen in the ""Newest"" or searched for or found in people's ""Publsihed"" sections"

 there are a lot of people on the forum who are respectful

 on topic

 and considerate of others. It'd be nice to have semi-leaders or something (Being ""Regular"" is really cool

 though)"

Hopscotch Compared to other Coding Places (Conversation)

"[quote=""MR.GAM3R

 post:70

A lot of people working there previously left :(

We really need to get Hopscotch popular among working because it is an amazing tool for learning how to program. It kind of makes me frustrated when I hear that such a good app has very few developers. üòï"

 I've heard of those coding cites. But at that point it seems like learning JavaScript would be much more useful. Hopscotch is great for beginners

 but Scratch and Tynker seem a little but more advanced and less friendly to use.

(Hopscotch has the nice iOS 7-ey feel to it

 less skeuomorphic)

But since it's only for iOS it's harder to get a lot of people working on it.

 it was illegal

 it is better than MagmaPOP's 3D projects (MP's 3d projects weren't 3d at all. It was the illusion of 3d projection

This is literally the best part. Also near the end where it like

""And the worlds 2 largest superpowers were about to attack each other but then they went

 ""wait. That would mean the end of the world!"" So they just spied at each other with fancy missiles"""

 not yet

We did yuse the MOAB

 mother of all bombs"

[details=Dude! I found the script! Sorry for the swears in it

 though..]

you're on a rock floating in space.

pretty cool

 huh?

some of it's water.

fuck it

 actually most of it's water.

i can't even get from here to there without buying a boat.

it's sad.

i'm sad.

i miss you.

how did this happen?

a long time ago

 actually never

 and also now

 nothing is nowhere.

when?

never.

makes sense

like i said

 it didn't happen.

nothing was never anywhere.

that's why it's been everywhere.

it's been so everywhere you don't need a where.

you don't even need a when.

that's how every it gets.

forget this.

i wanna be something.

go somewhere.

do something.

i want things to change.

i want to invent time and space.

and i know it's possible because everything is here and it probably already happened.

i just don't know when to start.

and that's exactly where it started.

whoah

 i paused it.

i think there's a universe now.

what's it made of?

quarks & stuff

ah

 that's a thing.

in a place.

don't like it?

try a new place.

at a different time‚Ñ¢.

try to stick together

 because the world is gonna get bigger.

and emptier.

but it's not empty yet.

it's still very full

 and about a kjghpillion degrees.

great news!

the quarks are now happily married

 in groups of three called a proton or a neutron

and there's something else flying around too that wants to join in but can't cause it's still too

HOT

the protons and neutrons are now happily married to each other.

and some of them even doubled up.

great news

 the electrons have now joined in

congratulations

 the world is now a bunch of gas in space.

but it's getting closer together.

and it's getting closer together.

and it's getting closer toge-

it's a star

new shit just got made!

some stars burn out and die.

bigger stars burn out and die with passion

 and make some brand new

 way crazier shit.

space dust

which allows newer

 more interesting stars to be made

 and then die

 and explode into

even crazier space dust

so now stars have cool stuff around them

 like rocks

 ice

 and funny clouds

 which can make some very interesting things.

like this ball of flaming rocks for example.

holy shit

 we just got hit with another ball of flaming rocks.

and it kind of made a mess.

which is

now the moon

weather update:

it's raining rocks from outer space.

those rocks might have had water inside them

 and now there's hot steam in the sky.

cooler temperatures today

 and the floor is no longer lava.

it's raining.

severe flooding alert:

the entire world is now an ocean.

volcano alert:

that's land!

there's life in the ocean

what?

something's alive in the ocean

oh cool

 like a plant or an animal?

no

 a microscopic speck.

it lives at the bottom of the ocean and eats chemical soup

 which is being served hot and fresh

 made from gnarly space ingredients left over from when it was raining rocks or whatever.

oh yeah

 and it can do that.

it has secret instructions written inside itself telling it how to build another one of itself.

so that's pretty nifty

 i would say.

tired of living at the bottom of the ocean?

now you can eat sunlight!

using a revolutionary technique

 you can convert sunlight into food

taste the sun

side effect: now there's oxygen everywhere and the sky's blue.

then the earth might have been a snowball for a while

 maybe even a couple of times.

it's a sponge.

it's a plant.

it's a worm

 and some other types of weird strange water bugs and strange fish.

it's the Cambrian explosion

""wow

 that's animals and stuff""

but we're still in the ocean

 can we go on land?

why?

the sun is a deadly lazer

oh okay.

not anymore

 there's a blanket

now the animals can go on land.

come on

 animals

 let's go on land!

nope

 can't walk yet.

and there's no food yet

 so i don't care.

ok

 will you learn to walk if there's plants up here?

maybe

 said some bugs

 and fish.

 so i can go on land

 but i have to go back in the water to

have babies

learn to use an egg.

i was already doing that.

use a stronger egg.

put water in it.

have a baby

 on land

 in an egg.

water is in the egg.

baby

 in the egg

 in the water

 in the egg.

works for me.

bye bye ocean

and now everything's huge.

including bugs.

wanna see a map of the land?

sure.

oh fuck

 now everything's dead.

just kidding

 here are the survivors.

keep your eye on this one because it's about to become the dinosaurs.

here's another map of the land.

yeah

 it broke apart

 don't worry about it

 it does that all the time.

here comes a meteor.

and the dinosaurs are gone

it's mammal time

 here come the mammals.

look at those breasts.

now they're gonna dominate the world and one of them just learned how to grab stuff.

and walk.

 like

 walk like that.

and grab stuff at the same time.

and bang rocks together to make pointed rocks.

""ouch""

and set things on fire.

""yeouch""

and make crazy sounds with their voice.

""gneurshk""

which can mean different things.

that's a human person

and now they're everywhere.

almost.

ice age

what

 you can walk over here?

cool.

well i guess we're stuck here now.

let's review.

there's people on the planet.

and they're chasing their food.

 time to plant some grass.

look at this.

i control the food now.

now everyone will want to be my friend and live near me.

let's all build houses except mine is bigger because i own the food.

this is great

 i wonder if anyone else is doing this.

tired of using rocks for everything?

use metal.

it's underground.

better farming was just invented

 in a sweet dank valley right in between these two rivers.

and the animals are helping.

guess what happens next

more food.

and more people who came to buy the food.

now you need people to help make the food and keep track of the sales.

and now you need houses for people to live in and people to make the houses

 and now there's more people and they invent things

 which makes things better and more people come and there's more farming and more people to make more things for more people and now there's business

 money

 writing

 laws

 power.

Society

coming soon to a dank river valley near you.

meanwhile

 out in the middle of nowhere

 the horse is probably being tamed.

why is all my metal so lame and lumpy?

tired of using lame

 sad metal?

introducing

Bronze

made with special ingredient tin from the far lands of tin land.

i don't know

 my dealer won't tell me where he gets it.

also

 guess what?

egypt

 they figured out how to put wheels on a horse.

now we're getting somewhere.

china

and did i mention

indus river valley civilization

norte chico

the middle east is getting more complicated

 maybe because it's in the middle of the east.

knock knock

 er

 clop clop.

it's the people with the horses.

and they made an empire.

and then everyone else copied their horses.

greeks

ah look

 it must be the greeks

 a beta version of the greeks.

let's check in with the indus river valley civilization.

they're gone.

guess who's not gone?

new arrivals in india

 maybe it's those horse people i was talking about

 or their cousins or something

and they wrote some hymns and mantras and stuff

you could make a religion out of this.

there's the bronze age collapse.

now the phoenicians can get down to business

 can we switch to a metal that's a little easier to find?

thanks.

look who came back to israel

 it's the twelve tribes of israel.

and they believe in God

just 1 though

 he's got like a ten step program.

here's some huge heads.

must be the olmecs.

the phoenicians make some colonies.

the greeks copy their idea and make some colonies.

the phoenicians made a colony so big it makes colonies.

here comes the assyrian empire.

never mind

 it's the babylonian- median-

it's the Persian Empire

 that's big""

 the buddha was just enlightened.

who's the buddha?

this guy

 who sat under a tree for so long that he figured out how to ignore the fact that we're all dying.

oops

 china just broke

 but while it was breaking

 confucius was figuring out how to have good morals.

 the greeks just had the idea of thinking about stuff.

and right over here

 alexander just had the idea of conquering the entire persian empire.

it's a great idea.

he was great.

and now he's dead.

hopefully the rest of the gang will be able to share the empire evenly between them.

 it's chandragupta

 he says get the hell out of here.

will you get the hell out of here if i give you 500 elephants?

ok thanks

 bye

time to conquer all of india

most of india

but what about this part?

that's the tamil kings

 no one conquers the tamil kings.

who are the tamil kings?

merchants

and they've got spices

who would like to buy the spices?

me

 said the arabians

 swiftly buying it and selling it to the rest of the world.

hey

 china put itself back together again

 with good morals as their main philosophy.

actually

 they have three main philosophies.

out here

 the horse nomads run wild and free

 and they would like to ransack your city.

let's check the greekification levels of the greekified kingdoms.

greekification overload!

bye

 said the parthians.

 said the jews.

hi

 said the parthians

 taking over the entire place.

heyyyyyyyy

 said the romans

 eating the entire mediterranean for breakfast.

thanks for invading our homeland

 said the jews

 who were starting to get tired of people invading their homeland.

 everything's great

 said some guy who seems to be getting very popular and is then arrested and killed for being too popular

 which only makes him more popular.

want silk?

now you can buy it from china.

they just made a

brand new road to the world

or you can

get there on water

sick! new trade routes! said india

 accidentally spreading their religion to the entire southeast.

hmm

 that's a good place for an epic trading kingdom.

there goes buddhism traveling up the silk road.

i wonder if it'll reach china before it collapses again.

remember the persian empire?

yep

 said the persians

 making a new one.

axum is getting so powerful they would like to build a long stick.

has anyone populated madagascar yet?

let's do it together.

china is whole again

then it broke again

still can't cross the sahara desert?

try camels.

hell yeah! now we've got business

said the ghana empire

 selling lots of gold

 and slaves

 i live in the roman empire

 and i was wondering

is loving jesus legal yet?

no.

 sure

 said constantine

 moving the capital way over here to be closer to his

main rival

don't worry about rome

 it won't fall.

it's the golden age of india

there's the gupta empire

 not chandragupta

 just gupta.

first name chandra.

the first.

guess who's in rome?

barbarians

what's a barbarian?

non-romans

 being invaded by non-romans.

r.i.p.

 roman empire

 actually just half of it

 the other half is just fine

 but it's not in rome anymore so let's give it a new name.

the mayans have figured out the stars

oh and here's a huge city

 population: everyone

the g√∂kt√ºrks have taken over the entire eurasian steppe.

great job

 g√∂kt√ºrks.

how's india?

broken.

how's china?

back together

how's those trading kingdoms?

bigger

 and there's more of them

korea has 3 kingdoms.

japan has a kingdom

 it's the sunrise kingdom.

deep in the arabian desert

 on the top of a mountain

 the real god whispers in muhammed's ear.

so he goes down to the cube where everyone worships gods and he tells them their gods are all fake.

and everyone got so mad at him that he had to leave town and go to a different town.

and maybe conquer the world as well.

the roman empire is long gone

 but somehow the pope is still the pope.

plus there's

new kingdoms all over europe

i wonder if there's room for moors.

here's all the wisdom.

in a house.

it's the baghdad house of wisdom.

just in time for the

islamic golden age

let's bring stuff to the coast and sell it

 and become the swahili on the swahili coast

 said the swahili on the swahili coast.

remember this tiny space you have to go through to get from here to there?

someone owns that now.

wanna get enlightened in the middle of nowhere?

the franks have the biggest kingdom in europe

 and the pope is so proud that he invites the king over for christmas.

surprise! you're the new roman emperor

 said the pope

 pretending to still be part of the roman empire.

then the franks broke their kingdom into what will later be called france and not france.

but the northerners

 or just norse if you don't have much time

 are exploring.

they go north

 from the north to the northern north.

and they find some land.

two types of land.

and they name them accordingly.

they also invade some other places

 and get called many names

 such as vikings.

there's the rus.

the kievan rus.

are they vikings?

i don't think so

 said the kievan rus.

 fair enough.

the pope is ready to make some more emperors.

of the ""roman empire"".

the holy roman empire.

it's actually germany but don't worry about it.

new kingdoms.

christianize all the kingdoms

which brand would you like?

mine's better.

time to conquer england

 said william.

it's a bird

 it's a plane

it's the seljuk turks

aah! said the byzantine empire who's getting so small and almost doesn't exist anymore.

we need help!

they need help

 so they call the pope.

hey pope

 can you help us get rid of the seljuks?

maybe take back the holy land on the way?

 i know you want to take back the holy land.

yes

 i do actually want to do that.

let's do a crusade.

crusade

they did many crusades

 some of which almost didn't fail.

but at least the italians got some sweet trade deals.

goodbye mayans.

hello toltecs

goodbye toltecs.

hello mississippi

look at those mounds.

there's the pueblo.

i always wondered how to build a town in a cliff.

guess who's here?

khmer.

where?

here.

and pagan is there.

vietnam unconquered itself

 korea just became itself

 and japan is so addicted to art that the military might have to take over the government.

china just invented bombs

 and typing.

and the mongols just invaded most of the universe.

nice going

 Genghis!

i bet that will last a long time.

some of the islamic turks were unaffected by the mongol invasions because they were busy invading india.

is it tonga time?

i think it's tonga time.

i just found out where the swahili gets all their gold.

look at this chad.

means ""lake"".

there's an empire there.

right in the middle of

Africa

the king of mali is so rich he's going on tour to let everyone know.

wow

 that guy's rich

 everyone said.

the christians are doing a great job reconquering iberia

 which will soon be called spain and not spain.

please remain christian.

we will check in later to see if you're still christian when you least expect.

whoops

 half of europe just died.

ming

china's back

 yay!

hey khmer

 time to share.

new kingdoms here and there.

oh

 look who controls all the islands.

it's the mahajapit.

majahapit.

mapajahit.

mahapajit.

majapahit?

 italy's really rich

 time for them to care a lot about art and the ancient classics.

it's kinda like a rebirth.

here's a printer.

let's make books.

so you think you can conquer the byzantine empire?

 said the ottoman turks.

nice job

 ottoman turks.

 you missed a spot.

don't forget to ban europe from the indian spice trade.

what? that's bullshit

 said portugal

 spiceless.

well i guess we'll have to find another way to india

wait! said christopher columbus

 probably smoking crack.

if the world is round

 let's go this way to india.

nah

 we already got this

 said portugal.

so chris goes to spain.

hey spain

 wanna hire me to find india by going around back of the world?

please?

ok.

so he sails into the ocean.

and discovers more ocean.

and then discovers the indies.

and japan.

let's draw a line to decide who gets which half of the world.

the aztec and inca empires are off to a great start.

i wonder if they know that europe just discovered their continent?

the habsburgs are marrying into so many royal families they might have to start marrying each other.

move over lithuania

 here comes moscow.

ivan wants to make russia great again.

move over timurids

 maybe go invade india or something.

persia just made persia persian again.

let's make it the other kind of islam.

the one where we thought the first guy should have been the other guy.

hey christians!

do you sin?

now you can buy your way out of hell.

that's bullshit.

this whole thing is bullshit.

that's a scam.

fuck the church.

here's 95 reasons why

 said martin luther

 in his new book

 which might have accidentally started the protestant reformation.

you know what would be magnificent

 said suleiman

 wearing an onion hat?

what if the ottoman empire was really big?

which it is now.

what if russia was big? said ivan

 trying not to be terrible.

portugal had a dream that they controlled the entire indian ocean

 including the spice trade.

and then that dream was real.

and spain realized that this is not india

 but they pillaged it anyway.

damn

 said england and france.

we gotta start pillaging some stuff.

then the dutch revolt and all the hipsters move to amsterdam.

 said amsterdam.

question 1: can you get to india through north america?

 but at least there's beaver.

question 2: steal the spice trade.

that's not a question

 but the dutch did it anyway.

sugar

guess where all the sugar's made?

in brazil.

stolen

and the caribbean.

and it's so god damn profitable you might forget to not do slavery.

the next thing on russia's to-do list is to get bigger.

britain and france are having a friendly discussion about who should control the entire world.

more specifically

 ohio.

then it escalates into a seven year discussion

 giving prussia a chance to show austria who's boss.

but what about britain and france

 did they figure out who's boss?

yes they did.

it's britain.

guess who's broke?

also britain.

so they start taxing the hell out of america.

fuck you

 says america

 declaring their independence

 and fighting for it.

and france helps them win

 now france is broke.

and britain'll have to send their prisoners to a different continent.

wait

 if france is broke

 why do the king and queen still wear such fancy dresses?

let's overthrow the palace and cut all their heads off! said robespierre

 cutting everybody's head off until someone eventually got mad and cut his head off.

you could make a reli- no

 don't.

haiti is staring to like the idea of a revolution.

especially the slaves

 who free themselves by killing their masters.

why didn't we think of this before?

 who's in charge of france now?

said napoleon

 trying to take over europe.

luckily

 they banished him to an island.

but he came back

 they banished him to another island.

there goes latin america

 becoming independent in the latin american wars of independence.

britain just figured out how to turn steam into power.

so now they can make

many different types of machines and factories with machines in them so they can make a lot of products real fast

then they invent some trains.

and conquer india and maybe put some trains there.

 china! said britain.

buy stuff from us!

nah dude

 we already got everything

 says china.

so britain tried to get them addicted to opium.

which worked

 actually.

but then china made it illegal and dumped it all into the sea.

so britain threw a hissy fit

 and made them open up five cities and give them an island.

britain and russia are playing a game where they try to stop each other from conquering afghanistan.

 the

sultan of oman lives in zanzibar now

""that's just where he lives""

india just had a revolution

 and they would like to govern themselves now.

 said britain

 governing them even harder than before.

technology is about to go crazy

the united states finally figured out whether slavery is good or bad.

it's bad

 they decided.

and then they continued manifesting their destiny

 which is to kill the rest of the natives and take their land and maybe kick out the mexicans too.

i know

 let's rape africa

 said europe

 scrambling to see who could rape it the fastest.

they never got ethiopia

britain and france are still hungry.

they never got thailand

the united states ran out of destiny to manifest

 so they're looking for more.

hawaii

cuba

 spain controls cuba.

well

 blame something on them and go to war!

what should we blame on spain?

let's blame the maine on spain.

so they blame the maine on spain.

now we're in business.

to celebrate

 they kick panama out of panama and make a canal

 connecting the two oceans.

britain just found oil in the middle east.

it makes cars go

china is so tired of being bossed around that they delete their old government and make a new

 stronger government

 which is accidentally weaker and controlled by a guy from the previous government.

europe hasn't had a war since the last war.

so they start world war 1.

look at those guns.

it's gonna be a great war.

so great we won't need a second one.

after it's over

 they blame germany.

russia went on strike and the workers overthrew the government.

now everyone's paycheck is the same.

communism

in the soviet union

the arabs revolt and britain helps.

now the ottoman empire's gone so we can give the

jewish people a place to live

hopefully the arabs won't mind.

let's cut the cake

 said sykes and picot

 carving up the remains of the not-so-ottoman-anymore empire.

except turkey

 turkey makes a brand new turkey

and then the saudis conquer arabia.

it just seemed like the right thing to do.

hello?

 it's the 1920's calling.

let's get in the car and drive to a party and listen to jazz on the radio and go to the movies.

the economy's great and it'll probably be great forever

 just kidding.

germany's back

 featuring hitler

 the angry mustache model.

and he's mad at the jews for existing.

japan is finally conquering the east

 and they're so excited they rape nanking way too hard.

they should probably just deny it.

hitler's out of control.

so the international community tackles him and then tries to explain why killing all the jews is a bad idea.

but he kills himself before they could explain it to him.

that's world war 2

bonus round!

pacific showdown.

united states vs. japan.

fight!

finish him

let's unite all the nations and have some

world peace

seems legit.

 i'm gandhi

 and if britain doesn't get the hell out of india

 i'm gonna starve myself in public.

 that worked?

bonus

 now there's pakistan.

actually two pakistans.

one of them can be bangladesh later.

the jews and the arabs finally figured out which one of them should live in the holy land.

 they both said at the same time.

let's divide up the land so everyone's happy.

sike

 they both get angrier

look out china

 there's a new china in china.

what's on the menu?

communism!

no thanks

 said the other china

 escaping to an island.

i wonder which one is the real china?

there's the korean war

 korea versus korea.

nobody wins

 then it's on pause forever.

let's meet the sponsors.

 it's the two global superpowers.

they're having a friendly debate over which economic system is good

 and which one is an evil virus of Satan.

and they both have atom bombs.

 that would be the end of the world.

let's just keep it cool and spy on each other instead.

and make sure we have enough atom bombs.

i'll race you to space.

now let's make some more countries fight themselves.

europe is tired of pillaging other continents

 so the continents they were pillaging are tired of being pillaged.

so here's a new map

 with new countries.

now you can't tell who they're being pillaged by.

the united states finally decided whether racism is good or bad.

they decided it's bad

 and the world agrees.

south africa might need another minute to think about it.

let's check the world population.

whoa.

okay.

technology's better too

 that might keep happening.

the soviet union decides to relax a little

 and accidentally falls apart.

europe makes a union

 so now they can all use the same money

 except britain

 because they don't feel like it.

let's check the mail.

surprise

 it's on the computer.

 someone just attacked america.

i bet they'll remember that.

phone call.

 it's in your pocket.

wanna learn everything?

now your phone's a computer

 which is in your pocket.

 the economy just crashed.

don't worry

 the big banks won't fail because they're not supposed to.

surprise!

flying robots.

with bombs.

wanna print a brain?

some people have no friends.

some people have no food.

the globe is warming

and the ocean is full of plastic

let's save the planet! said everybody

 not knowing how.

let's invent a thing inventor

 said the thing inventor inventor

 after being invented by a thing inventor.

that's pretty cool.

by the way

 where the hell are we?

"I don't think I want to be on the OMTL anymore. Now that we have custom groups

 I don't think we need the OMTL anymore. It is too oftenly misused and just having friend groups make more sense"

"What I can think of is major forum update/ideas would be used by the OMTL.

Competitions could be used for people who want to be in comps @CompMTL

Collabs tag lists could be used for people who are willing to join a collab @CollabMTL

Idk. Just some ideas. But there are more things made that use OMTL that shouldn't

 than withbthings that are appropriate for OMTL"

 I thought of that idea. It seems like it may work as a good reminder. (Yeah

 people have been blaming that you are the hacker of ScotchHop Team. (Sorry for spreading rumors). But it doesn't even make sense since you we are co-leading together. Ugh

I also had to remove myself from the OMTL because there's been some emotional things going on apparently and people are tagging everyone because of emotional reasons. And also because some were being actually mean and wanting attention. And the OMTL is being misused again. So I removed myself. I think that all the groups are really cool

I co-own it with Hermione and we've been in previous collabs together

Plus the creator of the collab

 UnderagedCoder

 is one of my best friends

(Plus

 I don't think I have the pass anymore)

 why would I help decode some of the encryptions and make topics about decrypting them if I were the hacker. If I actually was a hacker

 I would leave any messages to have them figure out who I was. I'd just say

 ""I hacked your account and you'll never find me"". Hackers never give out their personal info. This is why figuring out who the hacker is is a waste of time. They just want your attention (I've talking to Gobli about this). Sorry

 that was a confusing paragraph

and chances are if she wants an abortion

 underage

I'm having a little trouble what you're saying here. But having a baby is a commitment people make. They need to be ready to care for it if they decide to have one. They should wise and have good judgement. When having a baby

 you should not be able to take back your decision. Once the baby becomes a single cell

 the commitment starts. Taking back your commitment means to take a life. Taking a life is m.urder.

And before you tell me

 'oh what if they were r.aped?' most cases of abortions happen because of embarrassment over foolish decisions.

Abortion should not be tolerated

 because I believe it takes away the life of another human being

 who is the same as each and every one of us."

 I don't think they have a brute force check (I was trying to figure out a pass of my old account). What they need to do if the password was guess incorrectly 10 times

 it should come up with a screen that says

 email me the password or something of the like. Anyways

 they really need to implement that. It would definitely be helpful

I think that they did not guess the password as it is *highly* unlikely. (It would take 100 years for a top precision computer to brute force it. Even more time since the hacker *probably* isn't wasting their supercomputer on a silly kids coding app.

"Ooh! Primality tests! I have discovered a primaliy test myself (although quite by accident) with the use of polygons. 

 create any n-gon you'd like. Start at a point

 and draw a line from that point to the next point closest to it. Then

 do that again in the same direction

 but instead of going to the next point

 go to the next one

 2 points over. Then 3

 then 4

 and 5. This eventually creates a pattern.

(Sorry if this seemed confusing

 I'll add a picture below and a better explanation)

           ‚Ä¢ (a)

     ‚Ä¢ (e)       ‚Ä¢ (b)

      ‚Ä¢ (d)     ‚Ä¢ (c)

So you draw a line from A to B

 B to D

 D to B

 B to A

 A to A

 and it repeats itself

So as I draw lines from point to point

 it increases by increments of 1. For any n-gon where ""n"" is divisible by 2

 the line pattern we've made is rotationally symmetrical (180 to 180). 

For any n-gon where ""n"" is prime

 the line pattern we made is not symmetrical whatsoever (Now you might be saying

 ""Ah

 but what happens when you have an n-gin where 'n' is odd? I have a proof for this

For any n-gon where ""n"" is odd

 the line pattern we made is not symmetrical

 but some points that the line travels through get reused

 whereas prime n-gons do not. Here's a picture to help understanding:

 thank you!

I have realized through the years that learning math at school is absolutely terrible.

[details=A whole rant about why school and math don't go together]

Most schools teach math in a very uninspiring way

 a way that'll make people feel like math is boring and a waste of time. However

 there are some people

 who just love math. I don't know why I started to love math

 but I remember in Kindergarten being fascinated with areas of mathematics like multiplication and quadrillions and large numbers (Googology is a lot of fun

 I used to to extremely interested in large numbers

 and still am

 and there's a whole wiki about it! üòÑ). I had heard of these things outside of school

 outside of what they were teaching us. This kind of creates a curiousness and the natural love of math because you begin to descover

 ""Woah. There's a ***LOT*** more out there than what is being taught at school."" School kind of shows the tip of the ice burg of mathematics

 but they do it in such an uninspiring way that most kids never want to find out the hidden mysteries underneath. That is why it is crucial that if you want to learn math

 be good at it

 and have fun with it

 you must do it in you're own time

I have been some Khan Academy

 I realized that I could do trig over the summer

 but a lot of it was review in a way

 and I also really despise the videos. They are really boring. I did find a section of math in Khan

 but at the very end of the math journey. It's called

 ""Math for fun and glory"". They only show videos and it's a lot of fun

 I definitely would recommend it (I must admit I would've been even more excited about it a year or 2 ago since I've learned the math topics by watching things like Numberphile) (Also

 they bring on a different person

 I forget her name

 but she does *actual* drawing with a marker on lined paper. It is absolutely glorious).

just you

 the internet

 and whatever you want to learn about.

 I had realized that very quickly when I decided that math had become my life. However

 without a core study place

 you have no 100% proof that your actually going to find a place where you can learn math that is fun and easy (Especially for topics like calculus and abstract algebra and higher dimensional math -- which is an absolute bummer because these subjects are so fascinating).

Throughout that past year

 I have been watching Numberphile very thouroughly. I also found a new YouTube channel called 3Blue1Brown that teaches many things like calculus. I had also been able to collect some books to make a mathematical bookshelf

 which I am very excited about. (Some of my favorites were

 Hyperspace (when looking online for it

 type: Hyperspace (book) )

 What to make and do in the 4th dimension

 and Ian Stewart's mathematical cabinet (And also ""What if?"" by xkcd).

I have also realized that math and science literally go hand in hand

 which is a whole new thing

 I've typed a lot

 I get really excited about math when I'm able to talk about it with people who have the same kind of passion for it

 thank you so much!

 I created a topic here on the forum a few weeks ago that show math recourses people can use

 I'm probably going to fix it up and add some more. I think it is a great idea so that people who are bored in school can find amazing ways to learn (The girl who talks in the ""Math for fun and glory"" even admits that school math is boring

 she just doodles all class about more interesting parts of math (hehe

 I did that in my Algebra 2 class

 but I probably should have.)

I will definitely check out the math.fever *and* go onto the AoPS forum

 thank you so much for suggesting them!

I really dislike the skill/drill stuff from school and shoving everything in your mind through boring lectures only to regurgitate it onto tests and then forgetting everything a few minutes later. It really stinks. It's a bummer that every singe school is like that.

(The school I went to last year puffed themselves up saying they were the best and incredible and all that jazz

 but the teachers were just uninspiring and it was lame. A huge let down. That's why I've been trying to scavenge through the internet finding anything

i wouldn‚Äôt take the courses without a good understanding of the basics of calc

 I should probably read a book or 2 on it (or probably the actual AoPS book). I just completed Algebra 2 and I learned nearly all of Trig on Khan Academy

 but I have not whatsoever touched Pre Calc yet. I was shown the completion quiz of trig/precalc

 which was neat

 but I am not too sure if I'd be able to understand the calc class yet. (I hear calculus is just an advanced version of Algebra + Geometry + Alg.2 + Trig + PreCalc shoved into one awesome course. So learning and mastering the basics of all these subjects are most likely crucial) (I also found a YouTube series on Calculus made by 3Blue1Brown that I'm going to be watching really soon

 that's probably going to be a big help)

So my main question is whether or not the AoPS group chat lessons are any good or not.

 it will either prove or disprove a great many other conjectures and theorems. They were talking about how all the great mathemetitians are still going through it trying to understand what in the world (or should I say universe) he had just invented. Anyways

 I know nothing about it myself

 but it seems like something that would be awesome to explore

 I finally figured out the term of mathematics that's based on the fun/puzzles/inventing/conjecturing. It's called recreational mathematics (there was a book called: A journal of recreational mathematics

 you do make a fair point

 it would be nice and efficient let anyone create group tags. You can email the creator of Discourse about that because I think it's a pretty neat idea.

 if people begin creating random tags left and right

 it sort of becomes disorganized. It's nice to have a limited amount of tags (So maybe 2 or 3 per account for gt's + other things). And then if we would like to create more tags

 we can ask a moderator to do so

(And btw

"Thanks for the new Game Changers @Liza!

 my younger brother coded Suoer Mario Maker

 and he is *super* excited that it got put on Game Changers! Thank you so much!"

"Hey there

 @CreationsOfaNoob!

I was wondering about creating a 3D projection game for Super Mario Mini Games! I just need to figure out how the projection works

Here's what the game will look like:

![IMG_2920|230x129](upload://4M6yP3kUmtSHEfpuEFGq2JJE3uj.PNG)

It's a simplistic level and you'll be able to walk around and rotate the screen. 5 green stars are hidden around the level

Here's a video for what it looks like:

I was wondering how block would be able to be filled in with color and overlap lines that are located behind bricks.

Kind of like this:

![IMG_2921|222x167](upload://oa8N5t5fjUnqziE1RpWCS7so8am.PNG)

I don't even know how to color in the block

 much less cover objects with drawing. This is going to be some really challenging code.<hi I am a secret>."

"# News Updates

1/9/18

Hello again! My brother is still working on this truly epic Mario game. He is 100% finished with the main game (and tutorial) and is working on the Boss Fight and the end game. I'd say we will be finished by 1/14 and will start touching it up. We are trying to get the game out on the 19th

 because we will be leaving for a camp on that day. 

A few new Mario Minigames are also in the works

 and will be coming out shortly

 hopefully one of them before the truly epic Mario game

Last note: I've played through the entire game already (except the boss fight and end game) and I am really excited with what my younger brother has been able to do! It will *definetely* be put on Game Changers! See y'all around üëå

12/1/17

Hey all

 my brother and I are working on one truly epic Mario game!

It's got levels and Star Coins and a lot of cool things.

 the game is too big to edit anymore

 so THT is currently editing the JSON to let it run faster.

At most

 this game will be completed in around 2-3 weeks.

Merry Christmas Everyone!

11/16/17

We published a new game yesterday! Check it out:

[details=Game]

11/15/17

Super Mario Maker has been posted on Game Changers! Wow! Thank you so much THT! This game was made by my younger brother

 and we are both super honored. Thanks again!

We are working on an actual Mario game with multiple levels. It's gonna be super cool! Around 60% completed so far!"

It'll be approved by THT soon

Can't wait! üò¨

@TheJonnyGamers 

Join the tag list to know when new projects arrive!"

"Yeah! I was actually thinking about that today

The hardest part might be making the actual game board.

Maybe it could be like Mario Party top 100 that just came out where you select which minigame you'd like to play

 then I could add updates with more games (and then a board later on!)

THT really need to work on a new version of Hopscotch where you can add updates to your projects without having to republish a new one. That'd be amazing"

"Here's the game!

 @Dylan329 and @William04GamerA! You guys are super de duper üòÑüëç"

"Oh well

 that's too bad. I was thinking of doing it in Phaser.<hi>io probably. It's a pretty cool platform that has a bunch of premade JavaScript code. My dad wanted my brother and I to create our games in phaser so we could learn JavaScript. That's probably where a 3d project like that needs to be done"

Adding New Mathamatical Functions Into HS!

 right? Or maybe I've been mistaken. I'm pretty sure they do

 there are a lot of things that Hoscotch can add that other programming languages already use

 Hopscotch is just the kicker to get you interested in powerful coding.

Typing about equal to in Hopscotch might be harder than actually typing a >

 < bound:

If (x > 10) & (x < 13)

 you never use about equal to in mathematical expressions (Well

 I mean you do use it

 but it's just a rounding tool that you use in the answer of a problem. Like: 5.000123 ~ 5 or whatever. Easy to implement in Hopscotch. They don't need to ceate an entirely new block.)

And also being real hypocritical here

 Hopscotch should add a plus or minus math symbol. Let's make a page about new block ideas"

"New Block Ideas for Hopscotch (Wrong Topic. There's a newer one

 Sorry)"

"Hello! JonnyGamer here

 and this will be the official list of new block ideas for Hopscotch! Feel free to comment below your block idea

 and how it'll help Hopscotch

 and I'll add it in this post. Thanks!

<sub> <sub> For some reason

 opening Math Operators

 and then Movement causes a bug sometimes. Pls Help

[details=When Blocks (1)]

>**If (___) is Pressed/Not Pressed**

How it'll help: Buttons

 The Geometry Dash Rocket Phase

 a lot of cool ideas!

><sub> Really Advanced Piano Tiles

>Being able to *toss* or *fling* objects by dragging and releasing them. Like that Arcade Ball game

[details=Mathematical Operators (3)]

>**Plus or Minus Operator**

How it'll help: Quadratic Equations; Roots and Radicals

>**Nth root Operator**

How it'll help: Then we don't need to say 2^(1/3) to mean the 3rd root of 2. It's easier to understand.

>**The Complete Set of Boolean Operators** (Logic Gates)

How it'll help: Now we can do a bunch of stuff using Binary and can create Calculators and Mini Computers!

>and

 or

 not

 xor

 if then

 if and only if

 etc.

[details=Movement (1)]

>**Approach Point Block**

How it helps: This Block tells an object to approach a certain point on the screen. Then

 you'll be able to watch is smoothly move towards that point without needing to use pesky trig functions or watch it jaggedly move in the x axis

 then y axis

 then x..

[details=Looks and Sounds (4)]

>**Change Image Block**

How it'll help: Actually can make animations

>**Create Sound Block** (Maybe 3sec limit per block)

How it'll help: Create personalized music

Cons: THT will need to review your project if you use this

>**Adjusting the Volume of Sounds**

How it'll help: Now you can create music with Forticimo and other music stuff. You can make things quite or loud without the user manually changing the volume with the device

>**Text Concatenation**

How it'll help: Now you can add texts together to make one long paragraph

 or one of those cool randomized paragraphs

[details=Drawing (2)]

>**Choosing Color with a Color Wheel**

How it helps: When assigning to a specific color

 it'd be cool to see the entire color wheel and being able to choose a specific color instead of searching the web for the right HSB/RGB

>**Trail Transparency**

How it helps: Now you can choose the transparency of a trial

 and instead of a trail completely overlapping another trail

 it just blends to make a new color.

[details=Variables (3)]

>**Global Variable Assigning**

How it helps: Assign all variables a specific number

>**Using ""&"" when assigning Variables**

How it helps: Set chosen variables to a specific number using one block. Ex) [Set (Var1) & (Var2) to 7]

>**Input Variable**

How it helps: Keeps track of a user's input. You can find the nth (input) fibinacci number just by typing a number! The number is then run through the code and then outputted. Neat!

>>‚Ä¢ When (input) = 7

‚Ä¢ Repeat (input) times

‚Ä¢ Now quizzes don't have to be multiple choice?

‚Ä¢ If (input) = ""random text""

‚Ä¢ etc.

[details=Control Flow (1)]

>**Delete Clone Block**

How it helps: Now you can delete clones so that it frees up space! Ex) [Delete up to (15) Clones]

Woah! Really! Now we can do Animation?!

"Yeah! That's a great idea! Like a If an Object is being touched variable that can turn on and off depending on if your touching an object. That'd be super helpful!

What's the text variables Idea? Is it like naming a variable?"

Aw yeah! Input! That'd be great!

What's SBYP? <ksksksksmsmskj>

It'd be some pretty fabulous stuff! Right now it's really tricky to determine what is in front of what.

But aaare they in the team??

But just maaaybe <maybe it is me haha just kidding>

 2 Object is fine

 but 10 Object would be a lot harder.

(Funky 63 made an epic game called like Cave Jump or something

 and it's epic and somehow uses the ""Bring to Front"" and ""Send to Back"" really well)

And I believe the new update came out! Aw yeah!"

"Is that a pikachu?? Weird bug

That's super strange! I don't even know how that could've happened

‚Ä¢ Ignoring warnings from Leaders

‚Ä¢ Loging into a separate account to avoid a ban and/or removal (**7 Times**) (I'm losing track of the counts)

‚Ä¢ Cyber threats towards Hopscotchers

‚Ä¢ Frequently targeting certain mental disorders

**‚Ä¢ Posting multiple links and referring to **very** innaproprate sites**

‚Ä¢ Revealing personal information

‚Ä¢ Impersonating HS Forum accounts and framing them

‚Ä¢ Avoiding account removal by creating a new account

 t1 had even talked to them about this and had been suspended. Once the suspension was relieved

 they went straight back to breaking the Community guidelines.

I know it seems harsh to completely remove them (actually

 I don't know if it is possible or not)

 but I would rather keep the forum safe for children"

They had been suspended since May and then only recently got their ban uplifted. They waited for 5 months and won't relent (And some of the bullet points on the list he had just done and wouldn't have been on their if we had this back in May)

Awesome! We need all the support we can get

"I'm actually not sure if an account could be removed. If it isn't possible

 suspension would be good. It doesn't feel good to suspend/remove someone though :frowning: Like

# <a> We are having a convo on 2 topics at once

 i just didn't want their name to be revealed right now. I'm sure that THT knows who we're are talking about

 but I haven't heard from any of them in the past few months about this issue

 except for t1 when she banned them

 but now she's gone üò¶"

"I only know how to make blue

Type:

<<hi>a> 

Before any text to make it blue-sies

<a> I'm blue!"

"Dump of Faith?

A whole bunch of people have emailed THT as they aren't responded. It's kind of weird

 like asking for help and they're right there watching and it's like: halp us please"

The dump of faith! <heeeeyo>

"*aggressively* üòÇ Yeah

 pretty much"

 it's been really tough trying to contact the mods. It's a little frustrating to be honest

 but hopefully it'll be over soon.

Happy cake day by the way!"

I waited to see the glasses fall down and then they landed and that was it. üòÇ

"Yep. Apparently he blew up the math topic again today and I came an hour late. *way to go

 me*

It's not a fun time at all D<hi>:

"# HEY EVERYONE!

They got banned until Jan 13th! Thanks everyone for helping!"

 I probably misread it

 you right üòÇ"

 most likely.

Oh well

 at least we have 2 weeks of peace and quiet

Aaand.<hi>. I probably jinxed it

They were last seen like 30 mins ago. I'm assuming they voted idk"

Hey duuudes! They got suspended until Jan 13th!

"xse did. He was a reeal bad bully on the forum

<yeeeeeeeeeeeeessss>"

 he trashed a whole bunch of topics. Not fun at all"

 thank you! By the way

 Xse just got suspended until the 13th of January!

Hopefully

 it'll be a peaceful two weeks.

I'm also working on a new math topic since this one is mostly trashed up üò¶

I also created this new topic (you probably got OMTL'd that was basically for a vote of the suspension of him) so

 I'm glad that worked out!

See you around üëå"

"Yep. I remember that

I think THT said it was because some people were misusing the leadership thing or something. Or maybe it was you needed to be 18. Something or other"

"I know right! It's a super de duper relief!

Thnaks THT!"

"I'm learning it this year! I'm using the site called Brilliant.org

I've done the limits Chapter

 but I'll need to study up! Calculus is going to be a lot of fun üòÑ

I think there's a poll somewhere where people said which math class they were in or something. I'll go find it

 by the way

 have you heard of the xse situation on the previous topic? I was just wondering since you've read 33 min recently

 about the same time xse was banned. So I'm really hoping your not an alt account. Sorry"

"Oh yeah! I remember that! Yeah

 I remember when we all did like group stories on the docs. That was super awesome"

 maybe. But your post kind of was on the flame-y side. You really did get riled up

 you shouldn't take it that seriously.

Aaaand by the way

 he got banned until Jan 13th! Hooray!"

 I thought about that when I posted it üòÇ

I was seriously considering it to be conceiled or anonymous

and then I remembered your name was ""anonymous"" just to see your reaction. Haha

 I'll change it if you want me to"

"So apparently

 my poll wasn't public

 but 12.5% of Hopscotchers should be in Calculus (It was a poll consisting of 48 people

 so we'll see if they are still around)"

"He said a lot of people weren't people. It gives no reason though to get all out upset. It only encourages his behavior (which is a little weird to think about

 he just enjoys it when stuff like this happens. He's just looking for the reaction. If there were no reaction

 he'd just give up)"

On no! I missed my 100th post! Noooooo!"

 we had a big 'ol kerfluffle in the previous math topic. It's been really affecting the forum lately

 since he was bully<hi>ing everyone

 buuut

 he won't be back until the 13th of January. So we have about 2 weeks of peace so we can actually talk about math"

 that's what I am thinking. Just like when he was banned for a good 5 months in May

 he came back a few days ago and it all started up again. I'm not sure what to say

 but I am thankful that they banned him for 2 weeks"

I need to download Flash in my computer first. It's having some issues for some reason

 you know what

 you are totally right. I'm going to fix that"

"I changed it into:

Do you think that's good?"

How do you make a poll public.<hi>. Idk how

 that can totally be misread if you didn't know what I was talking about üòÇ"

"It says I can't change it after 5 minutes. Oh well

Brb or gtg everyone. See y'all later!"

"I'm not a regular üòï Aw man

 if a flame ware is about to start

 let's put it in the lounge

The user got suspended until the 13th of January so I think we'll probably be good for now

 exactly what I was thinking. That really is too bad

I saw that it said he had read 33 min recently so I asked him

<sub> and Healeybot asked him a little less subtly but you know

 it's ok

I really do think it is too much of a coincidence

And there's this person called ""123"" and I'm pretty sure he's related as well since ""hmu"" liked his post

We really are sorry

 hmu if you aren't. This really is a big bad misunderstanding"

I'm trying to get my parents to get it for me. We are watching the 3rd Hobbit movie

üîí Please don't ever enter this topic -- JG

"Oh man

 we're really sorry. I think we were all getting a little suspicious

 and we shouldn't have. Anyways

 becoming a member means I think you need to visit for a few days straight and get some requirements. I'll find it on the discourse"

 right! I'm super happy about this! Thanks everyone!"

 we are thinking hnu and 123 might be some of them

But we might be mistaken"

"My goodness. Let's make a new topic just so it can get run over again. This is pretty frustrating üòï

Aaand.<hi>. Yeah I'm not sure. I'm gonna sleep on it"

"@MR.GAM3R

Is it just me or did hnu delete all their posts?

:<hi>/"

 it is. We were hoping that it wasn't just an alt account

 but there's a lot of evidence pointing to it that it is.<hi>. Quite a bummer."

"Happy New Year! (Celebrate

 say thank you to others etc here!)"

"Woah! That's epic!

I think I should do something like this"

 congrats on becoming a member

Did you like my little jig back there?

@hnu"

"I just saw.

This is terrible.

Let's do this.

 now they have 4 or 5 accounts in total. So far"

<your a chicken but>"

"Yeppers

Most definitely

This situation is getting more and more annoying"

"I hope so. It's absolutely irritating

We need some more leaders on the Forums to help take care of situations like these"

 that's probably all we are gonna hear from them tonight I guess. I am going to sleep or something.

See y'all later üëå Okeedokes!"

"Heyo

 I see you are reading topics still. It seems that your are bored

 you wanna talk about inter-universal geometry? It's a very interesting theory

But if you are bored

 check out this epic math site called: proofwiki.org 

It's literally got everything"

 so on my treck to regular:

I've posted 37 out of the past 100 days

 but the requirement says I need to have visited at least 50. Hmm. So I'm assuming it'll be about 15-20 days until I become a regular again

Oh man"

"Hey guys. Guuuuess what!

I contacted the big guys at discourse and they said that this situation is not under their control. Oh well

 it was worth a shot"

 I am not sure. I think only admins can suspend

 but they are leaders on here. Not admins"

Unnecessary Flame war topic

"What happened to the new Numberphile Topic!?

 silly flame wars üò¶

"Yep. That really is too bad. I don't got regular yet üò¶

What even happened? There was like 40 posts on my notifications

"My goodness and you all flamed? What happened to just ignore the situation. You've gotta be kidding me

"Have you read proofwiki.org yet?

There's a whole bunch of math in it

"Uh. Doesn't posting also cost mobile data

Or is this worth your mobile data

 that makes sense. Cool

 coolio

 do you actually like math

 or not really

Nope. Hnu has officially appeared :<hi>(

"Have you watched the 3Blue1Brown YouTube series yet? It's real fascinating. You can do that tomorrow when you have WiFi or whatever

 if the quantum universe theory is correct

 there's universes out there where you just left the forum and minded your own business. And there's also universes where you're maturity level is that of a six year old. Oh wait

 this is one of them

 we're having an issue with this big bully and it's really unfourtunate üò¶ I can't even access my own topic now"

The Healeybot1 General Topic 2 [Cyber Bull.ying here]

"Or are you a chicken? I mean

 that is your name

üòÇ Sorry

That's probably not helping the situation"

"You know what

 that is a brilliant idea!

It's just that. Some people get all blown up about it and believe it's their right to smack them back into shape. Which is why I'm trying to get the user suspended

 but they keep appearing on separate accounts :frowning:"

 I'm not really sure what I am. A black blob with eyes and walk-y legs or something. I don't even know üòê"

"I'm literally just watching. 

Isn't there like a ""proove your a human"" test to sign up for this?"

 and your the kindest person I know. Right.<hi>."

 by the looks of it

 you have around 4. I think you can do better than that

"So can I call you communist now since

 I don't know

 it's on your profile pic"

"I don't hate you

 though. So maybe that makes around 3. I'm not sure. But I totally think you can do better. I know I could

 but I'm not gonna

 since I'm not an immature perv going around online talking about autistic stuff. Seriously

 if you had a summary of the past 6 months of what you completed

 I'm sure a lot of people would be reeeal proud"

"So now we need approval from your friends to make you happy? So now if they didn't approve of it

 you'd still be depressed? Or would you just go to 4chan"

"Thanks everyone for voting on this topic! It really means a lot!

Out of 50 users

 45 agree that this user should be banned for their acts."

"You also have the freedom whether or not to follow the community guidelines. If not followed

 the result will me suspension. You ready?"

 it's all good. I'm just annoyed about this situation"

"Okeedokes. This is officially another big downer

@Liza @moderators @Rodrigo

[quote=""MyPi

 topic:39692""]

And to tell you the truth

 people who are being mean to him/her deserve to be suspended more than s/he does.

I don't agree with this

 though. Just because people are frustrated at a user who says they are only here to troll and get some laughs

 doesn't mean they deserve to be suspended. Everyone makes mistakes and deserves a second chance.

Now

 if they are breaking the community guidlines in their frustration

 then they need to receive a warning. After the warning has been received

 and then ignored

 then can the leaders contemplate suspension.

But the fact that Xse/hnu overrid the moderators decision of suspension by creating new accounts and committing many more despicable acts

 means that he deserves a removal from the forum. Not because what kind of person he is

 but because we want to keep the forum safe for kids.

The reason  I created the topic with the list and the vote

 was because I wanted to get THT's attention. I wanted them to know how much of a big deal this was

 and how many people were being effected by it.

**and don‚Äôt try to justify this

 it is not right!**

I am not trying to justify the people who retaliated to Xse. I actually want to appolagize for this. I confess that I have retaliated poorly to the situation as well

 and it was not right.

But now that the situation has passed

 we all need to take a deep breathe and cool down. It's time to get back on track

[details=The FAQ]

What is the Shiggity-Diggity-Shak?

The Shiggity-Diggity-Shak is a lovely place to hand around and have a jig of a time. Remember to be cool as a bean and.<hi>. Don't forget to buy yams at the marker if you like 'me.

Where is the Yam Market?

The Yam Market is a market that specifically only sells yams

 and byproducts of yams. Yam Market's can be located in friendly neighborhood towns

 to big cities

 to mini gas station shoppies

 or sometimes in the good 'ol country. You can never run across too many of these markets.

How many spoons can you balance on your nose?

 I can balance 1 spoon for a good half a second

 but if I really want to have some supreme spoon balancing

 I need to get one of those big spoon ladles

 like for serving soup. Or pasta. Something big like that is easier to balance on your naval.

If spaghetts is sooo good

 why don't they make Spaghett's Markets?

 in the past couple of months

 yams and byproducts of yams have been all the rage. Especially in places like Greenland

 Iceland

 Finland

 Scotland

 and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However

 places like the U S of A are beginning to fall into the peer pressure of a Yam only diet. These rest are called YOD's because they are Yam only. If you or a loved one are feeling like they should be on a YOD

 drive to the nearest Yam Market!

Someone is living in the roof of my house. How do I deal with this?

 sometimes you can get a nice big broom

 or a pole

 and start knocking real hard on the ceiling. This usually gets the attention of roof squatters. Every once in a while

 these roof squatters are asleep

 so now it is your responsibility to climb your roof and make loud obnoxious noises. If the roof squatters still don't leave

 use them as a source of electricity and plug all your electronics into their laptop and drain their power!

Why can't I ever see elephants hiding in the trees?

Because they're real good at hiding.

How come my step Aunt Susie is invading our lawn?

If crazed aunts come over trampling your lawn

 beware! They may be under an intoxicating virus known as

 SuperStepAuntoPhobiaGrass. Whoever named that was a real genius. However

 please take these precautions if you think your crazed Aunt is invading lawns. ( 1. Stop Drop and roll. This will draw attention hopefully away from you. 2. Create a fort made of pillows

 couches

 couch cushions

 and chairs in your house. Your Aunt may be planning to attack. 3. Connect your fort to the fridge because you don't know how long you'll be in there. 4. If you happen to peer out the window and see that there is no grass on the lawn

 take caution. Soon

 you'll hear something in the fireplace. Step away from the fireplace and run across the hall. Never turn your back on the fireplace

 because your Aunt may secretly cross attack you with mystery cameras. 5. Once the fire is in the fireplace is unlit

 brace for impact

 as a lot of grass will suddenly shoot out!)

Will I get rewarded in Shmeckles for reading this far into the FAQ?

You betcha dogs you will! Here's 5 Shmeckles right now! I'm feeling real generous today.

What is the temperature of my shoes?

 it all depends on how sticky your feet are

 if you have been walking within the past 30 seconds

 depending on your age

 and depending on if you are also wearing socks inside

 or outside of the shoes. If you are very curious on the temperature of your shoes

 use a household thermometer. If the shoe's temperature exceeds that of the room temperature of your house

 these shoes are too warm. Place cold ice cubes into these shoes and wait until they melt. Dry out your shoes carefully and place them back onto your feet if you feel it is safe. Beware

 a common side effect can be cold feet

 so make sure you made your decision before hand and ask a friend to help you with your situation.

What is one thing that if I cut a hole in it

 it'll have less holes?

A net

 of course.

 let's see if he notices.)

* Be as chill as a bean (Well

 have you ever seen a bean be chill? These chill beans are so chill

 they sit there and chill out for a few days. Ipand im not talking about any regular old days. I'm talking about Sundays and Monday Mornings

 and even Leap Years and maybe even Ground Hogs Day I can't remember. Anyway

 what do these chill beans do as they chill out on Monday Mornings. You see

 one of these chill beans is named Fredrick Von Shpotz and he happens to be a good friend of award winning Fredrick Von Shpotz II (the Second) and they are as chill as a bean on top of banana pudding. And if you've ever tried that

 you are in for a surprise. It's as chill as you can get

 and really is self explanatory once you have seen for yourself. So do me a favor (favour if you live in Great Britain. Cheerio) and check it out for yourself. It is a real crowd pleaser.)

 Xse just hacked your account. You would never say that.

 Xse just created a new account 23 hours ago. You sneaky little man. I checked the accounts and I was right

@HeaIeybot1 @Healeybot1

2 different people. Check for yourselves

That's right

 friends look out for friends

(And also another reason why you all should have custom made profile pics)

But honestly

 Xse

 I didn't think you'd have the courage to admit it"

"Hey everyone. Xse is back

 but under the name Healeybot1

Somehow

 he bypassed the system and created a new username

 with the same username as Healeybot1.

If you find Healeybot1 swearing at you or at hnu

 it is not the real Healeybot1. Or is a phony!

Here's proof! Click on both tags to see the difference

 even though the names are the same and the profile pics are the same!

@Healeybot1 @HeaIeybot1 

The one on the left is the real one

The one on the right has an uppercase ""i"" as the ""L"" in Healeybot1

 and was created 23 hours ago

Forum Users Being Impersonated! -- Problem *Not* Fixed üëå

"This topic is about Forum users being **impersonated** on the Forum

 and how to protect yourself

 so I don't know if you all caught this

 but an hour ago

 a Forum user was impersonated. (8PM - 12PM Pacific Time)

Healeybot1 was framed by no other than you know who we've been talking about lately. It all came up in the Vandalized Numberphile Topic at post 88.

The following folders cointain hard evidence on how it happened

 and steps you can take to protect yourself from a cyber attack.

This post is a continuation of the bullyin<hi>g situation from this topic: [Current Bullyi<hi>ng on the Forum](http://forum.gethopscotch.com/t/current-bullying-on-the-forum-user-has-not-been-fully-removed-impersonating-hopscotchers/39623)

[details=How to know for sure Healeybot1 actually was impersonated]

This is the real tag

@HeaIeybot1

This is the fake tag

 used as a cyber attack

Even though the profile pictures are the same

 the names are actually not the same. If you look real closely at the ""L"" in Healeybot1

 you can see that the fake tag's ""L"" looks a little bit off. This is because it is actually an uppercase ""i"". Don't believe me? Try it for yourself and tag them (For all of you who were worried that they both had the same name and the bully had found an exploit)

The fake tag was also made 1 day ago

 which also proves it wasn't the real one.

 so this is a big issue. How do I prevent myself from getting impersonated and framed?

[details=How to protect yourself]

‚Ä¢ Create a custom gif profile pic

Pros: Now

 an impersonater cannot save the image

 because it's not an image. It's a gif

Cons: A little difficult to create. You need certain apps for this

‚Ä¢ Have your nickname be safe. Don't use these letters:

Oo0 (Oh's and Zero's)

l I (Lowercase L's and Uppercase i's)

Pros: Harder to impersonate!

Cons: You get 5 less characters

‚Ä¢ Create alternate accounts for yourself with all possible configurations of your name that could easily be misread as your username. Example: J0nnyGamer

 JOnnyGamer

 Jonnygamer

 JomyGanner

 and especially JonnyGamƒór (That little dot on top of the ""e"" is really tricky to spot).

Pros: Now impersonators can't *ever* impersonate you!

Cons: This takes a *really* long time

 and you'll need to create a bunch of new emails for yourself. But it's worth it. <sub> probably </sub>

Somewhere in Between: THT will be real happy to see a whole bunch of new users! <sub> Oh

 wait.<hi>.

‚Ä¢ Make a good impression on the forum

 so when stuff like this happens

 you can immediately say

 that is definitely not them. But be impersonated again

 oh well."" (Just like in the Healeybot1 case

 we could tell right away something fishy was up)

Pros: Hey

 nothing like being a trustworthy person with respect and frendos!

Cons: I can't think of any

 unless you want to be deliberately rude

 in which case

 this forum is not the best fit for you

This is a serious issue and is *currently* happening right now!

 I now know that Healeybot1 is as cool as a potato üëå

Keep a look out for *any* suspicious activity on the forums. Flag and Report all suspicions.

 I'd like to apologize to @Healeybot1 (real one) for sticking it through. He's had the rough end of the bully situation (and now he's getting tagged a whole lot). I want to say I'm real proud of you for keeping your cool and being awesome üëç

 it's an uppercase i

"Naw

 he just wanted the laughs.

 true. I didn't laugh

 but I'm sure he did when he saw our reactions. I don't know what to say. He's just doing it for the laughs

I can show you the convo between the discourse Guy and me

 ok thanks for your help

 and he kept going on and on about it

He didn't even spend a minute reading the post I made back their. Kind of got me upset (his user file said under 1 min read) or he just reads real quick"

If he‚Äôs all powerful why can‚Äôt he give the poor people food? The homeless people a home? There‚Äôs a lot of suffering in our world but god seemingly does nothing to stop it

Ooh! Here's the big whammmey!

This is one of the questions that are real hard to answer.

 there is suffering in this world. A whole bunch of it

 quite a lot of it.

 we brought this suffering upon ourselves (If you believe in the Bible). Basically

 we live in a fallen world with a bunch of evil stuff in it.

 God does give us a chance to choose him and live in a perfecto place. He sent his Son to die for us (because He loves us jut that mucho) so that we could have eternal life. But how do we receive this epic gift? By believing in him. That's it

 easy peasy lemon squeezy.

But wait wait wait

 but to your oriiiginal question:

Why can't He give the poor people food and the homeless homes?

 here we go: He calls us to give the poor food and the homeless homes. And in doing so

 we have shown them the same love that God shows us. And now they can do the same to others and so on. In other words

 the world becomes a happier place.

 everyone makes mistakes

 and we don't always do the right thing. But that's a-ok if we understand what we did wrong and try to change it as best we canners

Bug with bumping several clones at once

"Huh! This is a real sticker. I did some playing around and found some data

Once any object's (no matter the size

 I tried this with different objects) center reaches within 150 pixels (on Retina display

 300) of the Fan's center

 the collision occurs.

I also set the fans clone value to stop cloning once there are 11 clones (11 is the minimum value for this glitch to happen)

When the center's were 150 pixels away

 the collision did not occur

 when brought just a pixel closer

 the collision occurred.

That's it so far

 I'll be playing around a bit more üëå

Alright

 this bug seems to happen when there are 11 - 4095 clones.

Now I'm going to try to set the positions of the clones once they've been cloned"

"Thank you! Someone else understands that

 that question is a real toughy. They both end up in someone dying which is why it's hard to answer.

But anywaaaays

 it's the same thing from back in the 1800's. Certain groups of people thought slaves were less than human

 and now it's embryos. But in reality

 we are all humans. This is more of a political issue nowadays

 which is real interesting to observe.<hi>.

(When you said Prolife

 did you mean Prochoice? (Near the beginning) I'm getting a little confused)"

"But embryos still have the complete genetic information to create a human. They are a human

 how can something non-human turn into a human

And when does a human gain conscienceness? As soon as one is born? Or sometime before or after?

(I really don't know the answer to this question)

And usually

 abortions happen not when it's just the single celled embryo

 but when the baby is somewhat developed and noticeable."

"But a baby does not understand that they had killed a life if they killed one. However

 a person going through an abortion knows perfectly well that they a killing a baby on purpose. 

The reason you got pregnant in the first place *should've* been to have the baby

 not anything else. But

 if it's not the case

 most people would choose abortion than embarrassment

 which is why they say it isn't a life yet to cope with regret. But really

 people who have gone through abortions have this regret with them the rest of their lives (Which is also why people are terribly sad when they have a miscarriage. It's the same thing

 except now it's planned)"

"I'd like to friendly beg to differ on that:

[Difference between miscarriage and abortion](http://www.differencebetween.info/difference-between-abortion-and-miscarriages)

 I got to go

 there's one more link I need to find

See you later!"

We'll see about thaaat

"Oh boy

 Saints are ahead by 5 (or 4)"

"I want to repeat what I said before

 most abortions take place after the child is somewhat developed. And yes

 this is also called a planned miscarriage.

I also learned about the different types of abortions today

 and I nearly threw up. A lot of abortions have the doctor literally reach in

 kill the baby

 and take out and dispose parts of the baby

 *in front* of the mother. How gruesome even is that? That's like

 beyond terrible

 and it happens all the time. *Groooooss*

That's like

 total murde<hi>r

 I don't know what else to say

 sorry.

And before you tell me that it's fine to do this because it's a jumble of cells

 no biggie

 just think about it. Think about how absolutely terrifying it is. Man

 that's gross"

"# How to Forum

[details=Welcome Note]

Welcome to the Unnoficial Guide on How to Forum

 made by yooours truly

 and a lot of help from others.

I'd like to thank all you people who are taking the time to read this. I tried to make this as interesting as possible

 so here y'all go

[details=Why the Forum?]

 I see you are reading this post

 so.<hi>. Let's talk about the Forum!

**Why was this Forum created?**

The main reason that the big guys at Hopscotch bought the Forum was so that Hopscotchers

 like you and me

 could easily learn

 share

 and communicate with each other.

(Pretty much as a fix to the chat rooms that were muddying up the Newest section

 if you know what I mean. I think it still happens

 though üòê)

**Why are you here?**

 there may be a number of reasons why you are on the forum. The most popular reasons are:

- To easily learn

 and communicate with other Hopscotchers

- To hang around with friends in a stress free environment

**Wait? I thought it was code only

 though?**

 that's a great question! Back in the olden days before the categories were introduced

 saying something un-codey related was a big no-no.

 **Woah

 man

 must've been real strict**

Exactly

 we all soon realized that it is also fine and dandy to communicate with other Hopscotchers and have fun. We all have busy loves and we just need some recoop time

**But we can't go about willy nilly

 right? That'd just defeat the purpose!**

Right again

 you can't just go around speaking your mind in topics where people are in a deep convo about math. That'd just be disruptive

 annoying

 wouldn't benefit the conversation in any way

 your reputation would drop probably (unless you're too cool for school (Anonymous) ) and would probably result in a flag for being off topic.

**Alrighty

 so were can we relax

 so to speak?**

 totes my goats üêê"

That is truuuuue <nsmsmsmsmsms>

"I'm trying to formulate a post

 but I really don't know how to write it because I don't want to upset anyone. I hope this works:

I really appreciate that you did this

 it must of taken an hour or so to get all this down

 and I see that you really care about the state of the forum. You'll go far

 my friend üòÑ

I would like to give some advice here

 if you'll allow me. I've seen that a few of your ideas in here are a little bit oppinionative

 for example the how to deal with your anger section. If your frustrated with someone/thing or have just been having a bad day

 the forum really isn't the best place for that

 since it's a programming forum. 

If you are seriously frustrated with someone on the forum

 I'd choose to take some deep breaths and relax a bit. Once you've got your common senses

 try to put yourself in their shoes and think about them instead of yourself

 and how this situation may be effecting them. I'd say the best bet is to calmly work it out with the user

 or just take some time off of the forum. The forum shouldn't cause stress

 it should be a stress free environment where we are all excited to learn

 and have a good time. üëå Peace out"

"I've read 55

555 posts. Oh yeah üëå

@BlastFusion what is his reasons??"

 whoopsies! I must've misread it. My bad ü§ó"

"Aaaah

 since we are on the Big Bang theory

This theory is just lovely

 we've got zeeeero evidence

 and I honestly think it's gonna be debunked and passed up by a new scientific theory *real* soon (hyperdimensional multiverse Quantum string theory to be exact. Hoowie! It'll be an interesting time! üòÑ)

I'm like a total science/math buff. I take the stuff super seriously. I'd also like to talk about the universal background microwave radiation. It *should* be super symmetrical if the Big Bang really did happen. But

 it's not

 so we just put a rut in our own theory. Aw snapples D<sorry>:

Oi

 so what now?

Time to hyperact into Hyperion

 oh waaaait hold up.<hi>. Pretty close to 99% of all scientists/government officials are pretty darn happy with the theory they've produced. They're not gonna change anytime soon. (And now it's about politics. I reeeeally don't like politics and sciences mixing up. It's like curling milk. Real nasty)

And before you tell be the universe is expanding

 listen to this. The universe is expanding at an *in*constant rate. It's totally speeding up. That means the uranium is radiating at faster and faster rates because of the dark energy that is making the universe more and more into an elliptoid (there's about in average 4 hydrogen atoms in any given cubic meter in the universe

 which is why it's slightly an elliptoid.) it totally effects the radiation and the expansion rate of the universe. This paragraph probably doesn't make any sense

 it doesn't for me

You know what

 scratch that previous paragraph. So

 the universe is expanding

 right? That'd be some evidence that maybe we all started at a small point and then blamo'd to what we have now. Ooook

 but we haven't fully understood dark energy

 and why it's pushing us away from different galaxy clusters. Maybe it's a sine graph that pushes us out

 then pulls us back in

 but not terribly close. We really have no idea whatsoever with our pinpoint of 30 years of electronics. We shouldn't have a conclusion so soon

 let's wait another 13.7 billion years and find out. That's nothing on the cosmic scale. Idk broooos

All I know is that I cannot wait for a few million years until the Andromeda galaxy will collide with the Milky Way. Sounds horrifying

 but it's totally safe since stars are soooo far apart. And it'll be truly epic to watch. But I probs won't live for a few hundred million years. Unless reincarnation is a thing. In which I'm down for it. üòÇ

 that was a total ramble and I probably shouldn't post it cause I'm tired and I probably made some mistakes

 but

 brownie points for you if you literally read it all. I've got friends whom I debate with sometimes and they don't read the whole debate

 they just come up with a conclusion and I'm like

 come on bros. whatever though

 sorry for the raaambles"

False

Why.

You didn't even try to debate it.

You just said false."

Yeeeeah. I see what you mean

Ima just delete that post

"[quote=""Panthera

 when does life start?

I'm just gonna pull up the definition of life:

""the condition that distinguishes animals and plants from inorganic matter

 including the capacity for growth

 reproduction

 functional activity

 and continual change preceding de<yo>ath""

I'd say single called organisms are living things

 right? I mean like

 totes my goats bro. Bacteria is very much alive. It's a given.

Single called humans are totally living things. They've got the genetic make up

 (genes are a good thing) and a lot of cool cats I'm too laze to write the rest. Just reread the definition.

But I guess the real question is

 when is it morally ok to destroy a life?"

 I supposed you want an update on our super game. I'll be adding the News below

 just giving you a heads up."

"Like what?

I haven't seen any evidence whatsoever that's worthy of believing so far"

"Did you read my paragraph a few posts above üò¶

Maybe that's not indisputable

But we can neither provide indisputable evidence *for* or *against* this topic. It's completely irrelevant to our timeframe in existence. üòï

It takes faith to believe the Big Bang + evolution happened

 and it takes faith to believe in the existence of a supreme being. I'd argue it takes a whole lot more faith to be a naturalist."

I‚Äôd also like to talk about the universal background microwave radiation. It should be super symmetrical if the Big Bang really did happen. But

 it‚Äôs not

"üòÇ yeah

 it was a long post

If you drop a rock into a pond

 it gives those cool rings

 you know?

<sub> I like skipping rocks </sub>

The Big Bang should've done something similar

 but you have lots of hot spots in random places

 along with cold spots. It's uneven and really tricky."

"I'm.<hi>. not really sure üòÇ

There is such thing as the information theory (idk if that is what it is called) where we are able to trace back all history's about the universe through energy or something

Here's a vid

Here's another vid that is sorta depressing. Silly dark energy

You should totally watch Kurzgesagt

 that channel is super awesome in the math/science/astrology

These guys are naturalists

 which is pretty funny that I'm recommending this tou you üòÇ But it really gives some stuff to think about üëç"

"Okeedokes üëå

Post #450 aw yeah

Idk. The Big Bang theory is something that could either be suddenly proven or disproven (most likely disproven

 because that's what has happened to all of the previous universe origin explanations. They've been disproven and replaced with a new one)"

"Yeah pretty much üëå

If I weren't a Christian I guess I'd probably be agnostic

The thing with Christianity is that with a simple

 ""yeah sure there's a God""

 a whole bunch of things become answered and you're like

 ""Woah man

 that's pretty goochie""

Except now that's a religious debate and there's already a topic for that

I'm gonna take a debate break or something

Back to math üëç

 I'm gonna hang until post 1000

Your prettty close my dudes"

 I see the xse situation got in here too

That's unfortunado"

"I hope not!

I think it's like 5 flags or something within 100 days

 I've seen a bunch of seawolfwerehorse's and someone else posts (a flower pfp the name is escaping me) were flagged a whole bunch. Idk what happened

 they were regular posts

 too ü§î But that was a few years ago idk"

 that's too bad üò¶

It might be 7 or 10 I forget

 it's on discourse somewhere for the requirements of each trust level"

 that makes sense

 is it just me or does Intellection have like all their posts flagged. Idk"

Haha üòÇ The evil system

Only 70 more posts to goooooo

 he's a really cool dude. He's really inspirational"

"Aw man üò¶ I didn't know he left

That's too bad

"I wonder if Leaders can view who flagged who

You might wanna email Lisa about it or something if someone is specifically targeting you

And since you can flag a limited amount of posts per day

 maybe this person is waiting until they regenerate their flags üò¶"

"Thank you! 

Oh so you know who it is that is flagging you? That's too bad üò¶

<sub> Argh that reminds me of MyPi's guide to the forum

 it says to stick with the more popular people in an arguement but I totally disagree"

 I don't really care for popularity either

I like hanging around in the math category (that is

 not when Xse was here :<hi>/ ) and sometimes the random

60 more posts left!"

"I wanna make like a forum game or something

Like something cool using the Global Edit

Like an official hang around topic with games and stuff.

ü§î"

 it is a lot of fun

Anonymous is a pretty chill dude üëå

(I remember playing Forum hide and seek except it got annoying for some people üòÇ)"

"What if there was some sort of scavenger hunt game where you hide secret messages in posts and give clues

Waaaait

 even better idea:

A topic where we all create a story

 except

 each person can only say 1 sentence and then pass it to the next person (with a tag or something)

That could work with Global Edit if everyone stays chill"

"Whoops! I deleted the post on accident:

"Hey there Hopscotchers! Welcome to the Super Forum Story! Have a good time üëå

[details=Rules]

1. We will be creating a truly epic story

 except on the forum.

2. What I'm going to do is write the very first sentence

 and then tag someone.

3. The person tagged will write the next sentence to this story and can choose to tag someone else. (If the person tagged doesn't receive it within 5 minutes

 it is up for grabs üëç)

4. If a post isn't tagged

 anyone can create the next sentence! Just tell us so we don't get five people writing all at once.

5. When you write your sentence

 post it

 and then add it into the Global Edit post below

 so we can have the whole thing.

6. Have fun! Don't write anything innapropriate

 but you can keep it as interesting as you'd like üòÇ

7. Let's not have our heroes die. Put some imagination into the story

 please üòÇ

Once upon a time

 there was an egg named Eggbert Julius the third. @BlastFusion"

"Post put on a Global Edit

When you write your sentence

 and also put it here:

1<hi>. Once upon a time

 there was an egg named Eggbert Julius the Third

2. Julius cracked open and a dodo bird came out

3. Then the dodo bird died a terrible deat<hi>h when he was eaten by a pig name Oink

4. Oink was captured in a pok√©ball

5. Suddenly a magic penguin appeared

6. And then Julius Egbert willed himself back to life

 but to seek revenge upon the penguins!

7. And then the penguins viciously fried Eggbert

8. And then the dodo came back to life and attacked the mess of 2018

9. And then the dodo flew up into the sky

 glowing

 because none of us deserve it‚Äôs beauty

10. then the Dodo bird found an abandoned baby penguin all alone in the sky

11. But as the dodo flew up in the sky

 the penguins started plotting to take over the world with their magic

12. Dodo was so tired of all her flying that she didn‚Äôt have strength to attack the penguin.

13. As Dodo began to slowly fall down to the earth

 the thoughts began to race through their mind.

14. He burned up going through the atmosphere and died.

15. Dodo thought about how meaningless their life was as Eggbert Julius the Third and decided that they wouldn‚Äôt waste their new life as a Dodo and regained their energy just before hitting the floor.

16. Dodo squealed and burst into flames before falling into a lake.

17. As the penguin army approached Dodo

 Dodo secretly stole their Life Chrystals and hid in his secret safe zone.

18. The penguins

 not knowing about the secret safe zone all died and the Dodo ate all the Crystals to extend its life.

19. But the crystal did more then just extend its life

 it also...

20. Gave Dodo the ability to fly.

21. And it also gave Dodo invisibility.

22. But it also transformed Dodo into a muffin.

23. Dodo was perfectly content being a muffin in his safe zone

 so he decided to throw a super smashing' partay

24. But how was he supposed to send invitations without his feathers?

25. His muffin powers let him write and he wrote invitations for is friends: the other dodo and mister puffin and the tall giraffe.

26. Then he posted them and waited for them to arrive.

27. But he fell asleep.

28. When the party members cam they didn‚Äôt see dodo

 all they saw was an appetizing muffin and they thought it was party food so they ate it.

29. Dodo died in the mouth of his friends.

30. The former 'Dodo' was now a teabag that was in an icy incasement

31. He was now staring out in Penguin Headquarters.

32. He dyed his exterior and screamed

 ""I AM ALIIIVE!!!""

33. Dodo's a teabag now; Dodo was a muffin; His name is now teabag and he has no feathers to dye pink.

34. Also

 Teabag was completely incased in deep ice

 so when he screamed

 it was as if he were talking to himself.

35. The magical penguins didn't hear the teabag (Dodo) yell

 as they were conducting an experiment to retrieve their lost Life Chrystals (that Dodo stole)

36. Teabag became enraged and turned the ice into boiling water which he turned into tea.

37. When the penguins saw that the water had become tea

 they feared that Tea would melt the water under their feet.

38. The penguins grabbed buckets of sugar and other stuff and through them into the tea.

39. SweeTeaStuffz amped up the temperature and melted everything

 the ice included

 and the penguins fell and burned to deat<h>h.

40. Out of the water

 a figure appeared

 SweeTeaStuffz in human form.

41. When everything had melted

 Teabag fell into the abyss with the penguins and died

"Errr

Lemme check"

"It doesn't specifically say which devices can be used (uuuugh)

 but you do need iOS 9

 if it does load

 but only after a while

 maybe your iPad is just real laggity"

 weird

 do you have the newest version of HS?

I think the iPad Air 2 came out a few years ago (and apparently Apple forcefully makes older devices slow so that you buy the new ones üòï)"

 that might be the thingo

 since it might've been a pretty big one and won't let you open those projects

Paste this into your web browser"

I don't really know what to say

 try restarting your iPad

 it was worth a shot

 hmmm

 let's try to fix the App Store issue

Maybe you restricted it in the settings

(Does the app even appear on the home page?)"

 I'm looking up ways to solve this online:

- Unrestricted it in your settings

- Sign out and then back into your Apple ID

- Double click the home button and swipe up on the App Store page (killing the app)

- Clear the App Store Cache (Tap any of the buttons on bottom side of the screen when in the App Store 10 times in a row)

- Reset network settings"

Alrighty! Here we go

 time to make a topic"

Community Leaders on the Forum

"Edit: If you just saw this post

 Hopscotchers! I've been doodling around the Forum

 and I've heard from quite a few people that we should bring back Community Leaders! I'm here to discus in this topic the pros and cons on Community Leaders.

[details=What is a Leader?]

A Leader is a step above a Regular. Leaders can do all sorts of things

 and they have a huge responsibility. As of now

 you cannot will yourself to become a leader

 but the administration must choose you to become a leader.

[details=Why do we need new Community Leaders?]

We need someone who regularly checks the Forum

 and is able to keep it tidy and safe for kids. Recently

 there have been some issues that have compromised the kid-friendliness of the Forum

 and there wasn't a Leader to stomp it out (Well

 there was

 but that Leader has left the Forum

 and the issue has returned). This is the main reason why we need Community Leaders.

We would also like Leaders to host some competitions! We like fun and games on the Forum :<hi>D (Leaders are able to hand out some really cool prizes

 like a personalized nickname)

 Leaders are awesome for creating group tag list. It was really helpful when t1 was willing to do that for us as well as be an active Leader on the Forum!

[details=But how are we going to choose?]

There are 2 ways that would be good to choose Leaders:

‚Ä¢ Have a vote by the community

Pros: We can easily decide who would make a great Leader!

Cons: Most people would vote for popular people

 and popular may not be the best answer.

‚Ä¢ Have the Hopscotch Team look around and see for themselves who would be mature enough to make a great Leader

Pros: THT could use some good judgement and pick an awesome Leader

Cons: It might take a while

I propose an idea! If we do happen to create a voting topic

 here is how the voting/nominating should take place.

There will be a post *directly below* the official post that will be put on Global Edit. Each Hopscotcher will nominate 5 (and up) users

 and give explanations to why these users would make great Leaders. This would include acts of kindness

 being able to calm down a flame war

 being a really good friend

(If you see a specific person(s) are being nominated quite a bit

 try going for someone else! Everyone deserves a chance)

Post your nominations

 and then you may put them in the Global Edit. If THT happens to see the Global Edit page

 they will be able to review (easily) some pretty fantastic people!

[details=What do we do now?]

I'm just going to wait

 and see how this pans out.

Then I'll think about making a polling topic.

 be a good roll model and be super awesome!

Thanks for taking the time to read this

 by the way!

 we need Community Leaders!

- I think we will be OK for now

Thank you! -- @JonnyGamer

Flagging Comments 101

"Great Topic!

It's nice to see some people stepping up üëå"

 apparently polls don't work in folders :<hi>/

"Why is that a tag

<sub> *removes*"

"My first flag was when I said

 ""We are all hackers

 (in technical terms) because we are editing a program""

Maybe it wasn't the best thing to say on a hacker awareness topic"

"I don't know who flagged me

That was back in 2015 lol"

It could be community service :<hi>D

 we really need to mull it over"

"Yeah! That's a great idea!

That would be really cool

 so leaders can focus on a specific question

Like a math guru leader!

There are so many awesome ideas

 with the drawing topic escpecially

That was a crazy time üòÇ"

 that is very true

They were awesome leaders!

Being mature and respectful is a necessity for being a leader

(Haha

 the first drawing topic got 20

000 past the 10K limit)"

 that's really some amazing qualities

Those were the good 'ol days üôÇ

I hope that we can fix this bully situation üòï"

 this is a real dilemma (if that's how you spell dilemma)

We shall see how things go

 I guess"

 it really has with the Xse situation

It all started in May

 because that's when he first messed up stuff

T1 was there and she was really epic and got him banned (but now he's back and we don't have any Leaders)

We really need some leaders to clean things out

LazyLizard's Idea:

If there were to be leaders

 maybe there could be different categories of leaders. Like one Leader to focus on the math topics

 and a few leaders to harness the random stuff topic.

I think that'd be a really cool thing"

 that's true

Maybe it's more of a general thing

 I'm mostly gonna be around the math

 but you can find me elsewhere""

And if something really gets out of hand

 other leaders may step in

 I just hope we get Leaders soon so we can fix this issue"

Gots to go

"There's something seriously wrong with you

I don't think alcohol solved *any* of your problems"

"Because your the exact opposite of what you stated in the bullet points

When there's like 100 or so posts left until the Drawing Topic is maxed out

100 more postos until the max

"No one would ban you for no reason

That is why you've been banned before by THT for breaking the community guidelines.

I made this topic with you in mind

 don't worry"

 unlisted stuff

What's unlisted

 does it mean it becomes invisible?

@BlastFusion ?

@Petrichor nope :<h>/"

[details=A Quick Note]

Hey again üëã

I just wanted to add a quick thank you to all who read and participated in the 2 previous topics:

This topic is a recap on what happened in the previous topics. Now that we've got a whole bunch of people's perspectives and gathered some data

 (and I finally learned how to make a public poll) I created this recap to show the view of the Forum on Community Leaders. And to talk about a few ideas.

Special thanks to @HopscotchRemixer because you're awesome üëè 

This is gonna be one elongated post

 so props to you if you read it all üòÇ

I'm also going to be adding a special Global Edit post directly below this one so that you can add your awesome ideas üí°

>#### What are Community Leaders

 and why were they here?

> A long while back in the early days of the Forum

>She goes on to say that she and THT were adding community leaders to the Forum

 because it was getting really big

 and it was hard to manage all of our awesome posts! I'd recommend reading the link

 as it really explains why the leaders were on the forum

 what they were supposed to do. If you want the short version

 here's a summary:

>Leaders are just Regulars who have seen it all and set a positive example in all of their posts. The constantly demonstrate **kindness**

 **helpfulness**

 **maturity**

 and **excitement** on building Hopscotch. People who have been chosen to be Leaders on the Forum help manage the Forum's safety for kids and well being

 keep things happy and positive

 present useful answers to questions

 and make people excited to learn and share ideas.

>#### Where did all of the Community Leaders go?

>As time went on

>Liza describes how awesome the Community Leaders had been

 but had decided to remove the Leadership position because THT couldn't support the Leaders. *For now.<secret message hrmmhrm>.*

>However

 in May of 2017

 became the first Hopscotch intern that was previously a user

 just like you and me! Therefor

 she became a leader. She's really great

 and has helped out a lot on the Forum

 keeping things positive and fun. But

 she had become inactive in September of 2017.

>*Minor note*

>I recently just learned that @SmileyAlyssa and @Madi_Hopscotch_ (Previous Leaders) have become Hopscotch Curators! (As of Nov. 2017) They review the projects that have been nominated in the [Nominations for Featured](http://forum.gethopscotch.com/t/nominations-for-featured/6104) topic. Congrats guys! You can tag them at @hopscotch-curators 

>#### Should there be Community Leaders nowadays?

>I've heard from many people that there should be Community Leaders in the Forum nowadays. In a poll of 65 Hopscotchers

>But why do they think that?

>There are many reasons why these Forumers want Community Leaders back. The main reason is to keep the forum safe for kids

 positive

 and neat. This is because there has been a *major* bullyin<hi>g issue recently:

>These Hopscotchers want some Community Leaders back on the Forum so that in situations like this

 there will be an easy fix! But for now

 we need to stay alert

 keep our cool

 and keep doing what we've always done.

>Why can't The Hopscotch Team do this?

>As said on previous topics by Liza herself

 they can't contain the whole Forum! It's just too big with so much stuff going on. It's hard to keep track of it all. However

 some Community Leaders would easily eradicate this and set the Forums at ease.

>Why can't we just ignore this bull<hi>y?

>It's a little tricky when users come up into topics that have been put a lot of work into

 and start swearing

 breaking the community guidelines

 talking about illegal activity

 and telling *your own friends* that they are not people and/or that they are stupi<hi>d. Just flag and keep your cool

 and stand up for yourself and the Forum.

>#### Reasons for Community Leaders

>‚óè They keep the Forum positive

 clean

 and awesome!

>‚óè They answer tough questions and give awesome insight

>‚óè Theh create a safe environment for kids

>‚óè They are roll models to look up to!

>These reasons alone are enough to get me on board to having some new Community Leaders

>#### Reasons against Community Leaders

>‚óè Causes rivalry among Hopscotchers to become a Leader

>‚óè We can keep the Forum a positive place

 even if we don't have Leaders

>‚óè The idea of a ""special group"" of Hopscotchers that are better than the rest

>These reasons give some good conversations

 and maybe want to rethink how the Leadership role should be

@BlastFusion you've read the topic where I list all of the acts he's done right? I'm pretty certain it's intentional

‚Ä¢ Posting adult material (causes harm to naive kiddos)

‚Ä¢ Specifically targeting HealeyBot1 (player account even targeted him

 which is why I know it is xse)

‚Ä¢ Bypassing THT's banning process by creating new accounts

Forum Nuking -- Bug Fix Soon!

"Hey Hopscotchers! @William04GamerA and I reported the nuking ability to discourse. They have just fixed it

 so now there is a limit to how big the text font can be. An update to the forum will arrive shortly:

"Woah! That's really awesome!

How'd you make it??

It's some real trippy pizazz!"

"Woah! That's really creative!

(Now that I take a much closer look

 I can see the water bottle shape

 but it's still really amazing! I never could've guessed it was made from that. It's like a computerized quantum space type thing üòÑ)"

"Woooooah! Awesome! üòÑ

Now that's really cool

You should do a multicolored one (like one side smoothes into another color

 that might be hard with markers

 though. Or you could change the colors at each crease?)"

 nice! üëç

 we told Discouse about the nukem and they are sending a fix over real sooon. So no more nukems"

"# How to Break the Forum

This is the official guide on How to Break this Forum!

Please be respectful

 and do not use these ideas to vandalize or bully.

I created this topic for educational purposes

 don't abuse these ideas.

Keep this topic in the lounge

[details=1. Nuking a Topic]

How to nuke a topic:

While writing your post

 copy and paste this as much as possible: <bi<hi>g> @system 

It doesn't need to be @system

 you can write whatever you want.

[details=Effect]

Once you've posted a nuke

 it is impossible to delete

The effect of nuking a topic is wild:

 post:43

After a topic gets ‚Äúnuked‚Äù

 replying will be kinda glitchy. You won‚Äôt be able to directly respond to posts

 and the reply box will disappear if you dismiss the keyboard.

Is there a fix?

Once enough replies have been posted below the nuke

 the situation diverts and the page becomes normal again (unless you visit the nuked post)

[details=Screenshots]

![IMG_3127|333x250](upload://ldTzCgkqhI4nmHwacDIWhJKBlzv.PNG)![IMG_3126|333x250](upload://d1ufZqcewLic0PQBpdx32i4RuT0.PNG)![IMG_3125|333x250](upload://uAXhDg2aKvIEJ3RV0qeyGVgkCog.jpg)![IMG_3124|333x250](upload://wkZp8Jk57qkMxNABxhuqKZelb9Q.jpg)![IMG_3128|333x250](upload://i6uGkzuqwncxh8daFPHcEQJlgGU.jpg)

<sub> (They deleted my topic for whatever reason)

[details=2. Nuking a tag

 the ""latest"" section]

How to nukes the ""latest"" section:

When writing tags for your topic

 write one of them as: Ô∑ΩÔ∑ΩÔ∑ΩÔ∑ΩÔ∑ΩÔ∑ΩÔ∑ΩÔ∑ΩÔ∑ΩÔ∑ΩÔ∑ΩÔ∑ΩÔ∑ΩÔ∑ΩÔ∑ΩÔ∑ΩÔ∑ΩÔ∑ΩÔ∑ΩÔ∑Ω

Ô∑Ω is the widest unicode character that fits into the forum. And since you are only allowed to have a tag be at max 20 characters

 ""Ô∑Ω"" is the widest for this form.

Once you've edited in this nuke

 it is easy to delete (you must be regular to do it on someone else's topic)

 but it really messes up the ""latest"" section if you are on an Apple Device. (Chrome books are fine

 apparently)

![IMG_3123|333x250](upload://nefcKv8cr44NYFhFS3o6m6K3JbZ.PNG)

As of now

 Discourse does not know about this glitch.

[details=3. Fredrick (fredrick) but as a username: @Fredrick]

This is an interesting bug that takes use of the blocked words: If a word starts with f and ends in k

 the word becomes blocked: fredrick

 firetruck

 forgot-to-do-my-homework.

(fred<hi>rick

 fir<hi>etruck

 forgot-to-do-my-homework)

I have created an account called @fred<hi>rick and it is impossible to tag him: @Fredrick

It is impossible to tag @fred<hi>rick

 even though he shows up as a username. Eternal peace!

 unless the Hopscotch Team changes the guidelines of what to block

 and directly unblocks fred<hi>rick as an inappropriate word.

 MemorableChickenYay

 and I have stumbled upon yet another Forum bug. Hooray.

 this one is *really* neat! Now you can create your own emoticons!

How does this work?

As you may have noticed

 these use overlapping characters. Interesting bug

 right! To create these emoticons

 they must be on their own line.

How to create:

:<hi\>/

:<hi\>^

</sub\>

To keep the emoticon on your post (because it sometimes turns invisible) remember to type some words above and below the <sub\>'s. Thanks!

 the Forum was under maintence and then they took it down. It was insane

 apparently

 someone at discourse clicked the wrong button. It was real scary:

 is he banned?"

@CodeLife <testing testing>

"Apparently they were the oldest bully on the forum. or something

I was checking if they were banned"

"Dude the story should be that CodeLife is the main leader

 and xse and ohb are like henchmen or something"

"He was releasing other people's personal info it was real bad

Now he's banned for a millennia a whole thousand years forum record

dude I love the overlapping glitch

"Hey man

 you can't just go out an accuse people. It's not really the most polite thing to do

A lot of people are really chill in the forum

 wow that's super awesome. There really hasn't been too many issues

I'm not really sure

In that case

 there should be more user visits than active users. That's odd"

 there's usually some persons to calm everyone down anyway"

"32

000 characters worth of ideas üòÇ That's great

It's a bummer we can't do docs anymore

 why did they not allow it

I was inactive for some reason during that time

This guy runs out of soup in his house

 and he's gotta play mini games to earn some soup or prizes or win prize money and go to the store and buy some soup

(Maybe there's different stores that sell different kinds of soup

 so if your a noob

 you just buy some cheap soup off of some street seller or something idk) and soup stand üòÇ"

"Dumpster diving for soup

That could be a minigame üòÇ

There's a limit of 5 I think

That last one is great üòÇ

![IMG_3143|325x250](upload://bUHZi7TXgATixgbZF5zBmRVxgZU.PNG)

When you start the app

 he runs out of soup in an interesting cutscene

And maybe you go walk around town looking for soup

 and it says

 ""Soup Here: Level (x)"" and these are the Mini Games that reward you soup. You'd need to be a certain level to play certain Mini Games.

So many ideas üòÇ"

"Yes! And then maybe you could make your own soup shop or something

Or find ingredients as you are walking around the hub (like special collectibles hiding in places)

And then there could be funny things happening in the background

 like cars/bikes passing by

Or planes with those long wavy flags at the end

Or blimps

Or buildings with stuff in the windows

Or other people walking into across town strolling baby strollers (that can give you secret ingredients too üòÇ)

And then maybe mixing certain ingredients with your soup can give you power ups in Mini Games or something"

"Yeah! That'd be awesome

Clues hidden around the hub/city that lead you to secret ingredients üòÇ

There should be a paper napkin flying through the wind

 and when you tap on it

 you grab it and read a message written on the napkin üòÇ There should be riddles or something on here

And if you complete Mini Games over and over again

 you can farm coins or something (or complete missions to earn coins instead) to spend at the market and buy more types of ingredients"

Oh noes! Not mission: Fetch BlastFusion Investigators

He hasn't even posted in 15 hours

"Don't you dare read this secret message:

[spoiler] Get clickbaited [/spoiler]"

 I think the goal might be just to max out on levels or create all kind of soup. Or maybe just live a soup-erbulous life

We need soup puns üòÇ

(I feel like there could be an antagonist (like a mega company) who you are threatening because you've been making really good soups. But that might be too much üòÇ)"

Then when you are in your soup shop

 you could see the people dining in there üòÇ

(Eventually

 if you get really good

 there'd be a bunch of people crammed in your shop (and maybe even a line waiting outside) which is why there needs to be a maximum occupancy sign in the shop üòÇ)

What would the in game currency be? Coins or Xp?

I'm thinking the soup shop might be a separate page

 and then when you enter the kitchen

 you can customize your ingredients and make some soups.

 and then you can hire chefs to cook for customers"

"Hmm. There'd be 2 main aspects of the game

Running the soup shop

Earning money / finding ingredients / exploring

Nobody mess with his espresso machine üòÇ

 that'd be awesome

 I love the dumpster diving idea

The guy should literally dive into the dumpster

 and then play the mini game and win a prize

What would the next level be?

(Maybe

 if you earn enough coins <s>or experience</s>

 you can upgrade the dumpster to be something more fancy. Idk what

 that sounds great

Talking to people to complete quests. And if you complete someone's quest

 they'd give you a hint to where another quest-person could be (and then maybe you'd wait a while to do another quest from the same person

 that might be too much again. Maybe there are a set amount of quest people around the hub

 but you can only talk to them once your shop reaches a certain popularity rate

 or xp

I feel like this game could totally turn out great

I wish docs was still allowed then we could easily gather up the ideas"

 and 3 quests should be displayed at once

When you complete one of the quests (or all 3)

 a new quest appears (or a new set of quests)"

 one at a time would make more sense

 yeah"

I'll think of some things"

"Minor aspects: Simple retro songs during the mini games

Hub: not sure if it should be a loop. If you walk in one direction for long enough

 it should wrap back around.

Places you can visit in the hub:

‚Ä¢ Your Soup Shop

‚Ä¢ MarketPlace

‚Ä¢ Dumpster

‚Ä¢ Workplace (not sure if you still wanted this one. I think it was a second level of mini games?)

There should be apartment buildings lined in between the places of the hub. And trees and small decorations of the like. Just like filler space to make it seems a little larger

 since there are 4 places so far

Interactions with people:

‚Ä¢ Mailman: Idk

 I think it might be funny üòÇ

‚Ä¢ Person walking a baby stroller

‚Ä¢ Person walking a dog

‚Ä¢ Jogger

‚Ä¢ Random bystanders (common people)

Buttons on the top right corner:

Pause menu

Missions menu

Mail? Notifs?"

"Ah! I forgot about the bill board!

(There should be a news area displaying town news

 just some interesting reads

 and maybe some ingredients would be hidden on here)"

"You need to have a backpack button

 so you can see how many ingredients you've collected.

Should there be categories of ingredients

 so that they are easy to organize?"

"Haha üòÇ And if you tap the person walking the baby stroller

 you could steal the milk bottle üòÇ

And if you miss

 they just run off really quick

(There could also be some stuff growing in the trees too or bushes)

To collect an ingredient that is just lying about in the hub

 you should just tap on it

 just saw your post"

 there should be different categories of ingredients:

(Water would be a given)

Meats

‚Ä¢ chicken

‚Ä¢ beef

Veggies

‚Ä¢ tomatoes

‚Ä¢ carrots

‚Ä¢ onions

Spices

‚Ä¢ salt

‚Ä¢ pepper

‚Ä¢ tobacco sauce üòÇ

Other

‚Ä¢ exotic ingredients idk just something funny

 like a sock

Brewing a soup would also be instantaneous"

"Upon collecting ingredients

 it should just give you a mini notification on the side of your screen: (1 carrot collected) along with the picture

And if you've collected a certain ingredient for the first time

 it should have a little ""!"" next to it

 and make a collecting sound"

"Examples of certain mixtures:

(Last minute idea

 sometimes when you go dumpster diving like before

 you'd find a perfectly made soup (or it might just be a ""mystery substance""))

Veggie Soup:

Tomatoes x1

Carrots x2

Onions x1

Pepper x1"

"Not sure where we'd list off all of the different mixtures ü§î

 users could just experiment? Idk

Veggie+Veggie+Veggie

Potato Soup:

Potato+Veggie+Veggie

Beef Soup:

Beef+Potato+Veggie

Spicy Chicken Noodle Soup

Chicken+Noodle+Spices+Veggie

There we go!

Categories:

Potato üòÇ

Noodle"

 that sounds like a great idea!

(I think it could be simple

 like a veggie soup is just 3 veggies

 no matter what the type. That'd be easy to code)

Pea Soup

Pea+Pea+Spices

Beef Stroganoff

Beef+Noodle+Veggie

Noodles

Exotic"

"**Meats**

**Noodles**

**Exotic**

Sock

Etc. idk"

"I'm thinking the cooking system should be really easy to understand for players

There are 3 slots to enter food items in

 and if you slot them in correctly

 it creates a soup

Each category of food should have around 10 items in it. 10 types of meats

 10 types of veggies

Hmmm what do you think?"

I don't really know what a tardis is

 sounds great üëç

Maybe in updates or something more types of soups are added idk or more items. I feel like it might get tedious to code the soup combinations

 so we need it as simplistic as possible."

 it's like in Dr. Who?"

Yes! That'd be fabulous üòÇ Sounds pretty good

"Should there be a day/night cycle? That would be interesting. Some characters would come out at night and you'd interact with them

Get some raccoon meat üòÇ Yuk

Oh! Find a raccoon in the dumpster

 it triggers a mini game. Fight the raccoon! (If you defeat the raccoon

 you get whatever it was holding üòÇ)

If you lose a mini game in the dumpster

 you get ejected"

"Dude those things are so cool

I can't wait to harness the fourth dimension

Then we'd be able to do it

It'd be easy housing üòÇ"

 true

 that'd be really tricky

 I'm just all hyped up on ideas üòÇ

(But there needs to be a raccoon battle mini game üòÇ)"

 that could work! Then it wouldn't look too huge. If you tap on a garbage can

 you'd jump in it and trigger a mini game (and if you see a raccoon tail sticking out

 it'd automatically trigger the raccoon mini game üòÇ)"

 I wish it was possible"

<jajsjwkwk>Is it the ysu one üòÇ

"Places in the hub:

‚Ä¢ Soup Shop

‚Ä¢ Store

‚Ä¢ Town Square ???

‚Ä¢ workplace (were we still doing this?)

Interactions:

‚Ä¢ Garbage Cans

‚Ä¢ People

Town square would be like a place where a bunch of people would be sitting having coffee on their laptops or something. That might be tricky with the angle we are looking at

Mental awareness: Did Someone say that we are Mistakes? Because we Aren't! DO NOT FLAG TOO MUCH PLS!

"Lay off it

 you idi<h>ot"

Awesome! Sounds like a great idea and easy to code!

"That would be pretty interesting

 it may be a little too difficult

 but maybe there could be a color picker at the beginning of the game

(Or maybe 3 or 4 characters to choose from

 but it'd probably just be different colors)"

"I'm trying to figure out the cooking combinations hmm

I'm starting to code it right now"

 that sounds good

(Maybe a bar that you can drag back and forth that changes the color)"

"I just realized that the ""donut"" objects in Hopscotch are really hard to drag. If you tap in the middle

 it doesn't register üòï

I'm going to create a simplistic version of the cooking/mixing just to get the hard coding parts over with. Then I'll add some cool decorations"

Awesome! That looks great!

"I wish there were strings in Hopscotch so much

"Why can values be assigned to ""ipad"" and ""objects"" I literally had to spend 15 minutes figuring out what the issue was üòï

"@anon25890131

 here's a really simple version of adding ingredients to the 3 Ingredient sockets. Tap on an ingredient

 and it will automatically be added to a free socket. Tap on a socket with an ingredient in it to return it back to your inventory"

Wow! That's super incredible!

 thanks üòÑ <ksksksksksksj>"

 each page will have a different category of ingredients

This page would be the veggies page (I'll add more veggies)

And other pages with have spices

 meats

 noodles

 exotic ingredients

(I'm also thinking of adding the name of the Ingredient underneath each socket so that players can remember)"

"Somehow escort is blocked

esco<h>rt"

 when you are in the soup shop

 you'll be able to tap on the kitchen. The kitchen page will pop up

 showing the 3 ingredient sockets

 and an ingredient folder. When you open the folder

 it will display the ingredients

Hopefully it'll look pretty neat"

"### Ideas

This post is on Global Edit

It is the main post for all of our ideas

Not all of them have been added yet

 need some help

Super Soup Simulator

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Goal:

Run your own soup shop! Get popular and create types of soup while exploring a city. Gotta get that 5 star rating

Places:

Hub Area

The hub area is the main city place where you walk around and interact with things. You can also enter certain buildings

 trigger mini games

 complete quests

 and search for ingredients

The City works like a loop. If you walk in one direction for a certain amount of time

 you will be looped back around.

Soup Shop

Market / Grocery Store-Buy ingredients for your soup

Workplace-Hire new workers to work at your restaurant

Billboard (Bill‚Äôs Board XD) ‚Üê news

 hints

Bus Stop-Fast Travel Point

Interactive Stuff:

Garbage Cans

‚Ä¢ Jump in a garbage can to trigger a minigame (dumpster diving)

‚Ä¢ Raccoon in a can (boss-ish mini game) (or this could mean that certain can is closed)

People

 I think it might be funny

‚Ä¢ Person walking a dog/cat/pet

‚Ä¢Chefs(you can hire me to work at your restraunt)

‚Ä¢Families of 3 and 4(groups of bystanders)

‚Ä¢Celebrities(when they buy food from your restraunt your popularity goes up temporarily)

Activities:

Quests

Finding/Creating Soups

Minigames

Ingredients:

Exotic Ingredients

Creating Soups:

Every soup is made of 3 ingredients. When particular ingredients are put together in the kitchen

 an option appears telling you to

 ‚ÄúMix soup‚Äù

Once a soup is mixed and created

 the recipe is added in the Cookbook.

___

Workers-You can hire workers from the work palace to work at your soup restraunt. You have to pay them once

 and then they work forever. They automatically make soup

 just tell them what to make."

"### News Updates and Scheduling

"AHaha üòÇ The soup sound

 that was great

 I've noticed that with creating new accounts. The search bar is wacko for whatever reason"

 that sounds good üëå

Traveling through trash cans üòÇ

 how about the bus stop

When you wait at the bus stop

 you'll be transported to a place of interest"

"I love the idea of being able to jump into a trash can and dumpster dive üòÇ

![IMG_3153|230x140](upload://8OnunmTFfazyOZ8rE26zdbhLVsf.PNG)"

"I'm not sure how long the map will be. Maybe there should be a bus stop on either end of town

"Hey @Jordan!!! How you doing!!

Happy cake daaaay (I guess today is? I didn't see the cake 6 minutes ago)"

Woah! I didn't even notice the little garbage cans up close! Wow!

"Ah snap! I'd love to join

 but I'm already working on a collab!

If I do have time

 I'd love to join yours

Let me get back to you tomorrow üëå"

 we'll probably need to edit the JSON sooner or later üòÇ"

"Bus Stop

I'm thinking if you hang around the bus stop

 a huge bus swoops across the screen to and picks you up

 and then leaves. And while you are riding on the bus

 the places of interest map appears

 and you can choose which place to be dropped off at. Then

 you just appear at that location

![IMG_3155|344x250](upload://zOVbS5Apv3D1mD51TI9uukE0Ncp.PNG)"

"That's all good! üëå

We are glad you're helping us üòÑ"

"Are we going to make the furniture store? I just remembered that one

Quick sketch up of the Soup Shop

 that would be great

It'd be funny to see the shop bustling with people eating soup üòÇ

I was thinking a partial goal of the game is to get a 5 star review on the news paper

![IMG_3157|290x250](upload://7Gf3WfOsIvP9I3DHh5B9APwYgvv.PNG)

You could look at the newspaper in the News building

 and it'd have random articles from time to time üòÇ

But eventually

 it'd lead up to getting your soup on the front page with 5 stars or something idk"

 a draggable bug. Could be used to pick you up at the bus stop üòÇ

This one here is interactive (you can drag it left and right)

Yoooooooo man! <jajajajajajajaj>

 there are people walking around that you can interact with"

"Ooh! Yeah! If they Leon's like the soup

 there face becomes all red and run around the shop or something"

"I'm fine with it

 let me mull it over with our team members

 as the group is already getting a little bigguns"

"He called Healeybot1 the exact name that Xse had said. Out of nowhere

It's definetely Xse"

"Same.

I would land on a block

 and I would instantly die

 for some reason.

My record is 16 ü§î Idk if I'm playing it wrong

 but I do play geometry dash"

 it's super unfortunate that he's back

 ugh"

"Oh boyo

 I gotta read the first and second acts of Julius Ceaser over the weekend

Instead I'll probably make the soup Sim üòÇ

"There's a bunch of ""do not open"" projects in the collab

 so I'm wondering if I'm not allowed to open them

 or the name wasn't changed.

üëå Coolio"

"üòÇ Sounds good

I made some interesting bus thing if we end up integrating the bus stops idea

"Awesome Sausages üëå

 until they finally collided.""

But it was just a nespresso üòÇ"

 can we all just forget this or something? Not worth it to get all worked up about.

"Wow! Nice!

I'll go check it out and add some stuff!"

Added some touch ups to the trash can:

Should we bring back kid leaders and mods

"If you get flagged a certain amount of times

 you lose regular

I figured out a way to ""nuke"" topics recently

 and it made a topic essentially blocked

But then we told Discourse about it and they fixed it up

I also figured out how to make the layout on the ""newest"" extremely buggy

 so we told discourse about that too and they fixed it

Other than that

 the only thing that someone can do is spam tag the OMTL

 but you can easily remove yourself from it.

The only thing close to something extremely bad is the xse situation

 and the only thing we can do is flag him

 ignore him

 and contact THT. (Except he keeps on creating new accounts so idk)

 if someone does something terrible that makes the forum wonky

 we usually report it to discourse. But this has ever happened yet.

But I do think community leaders would be great

The only thing is that it creates competition because a ton of people want to be a leader

 and only a few can be that responsible (Apparently

 it's super tough work yikers)"

 just edited my posto

If THT were to elect leaders

 they'd have to spend time checking who is responsible to do it. Thankfully

 all of the leaders back in 2016 were pretty neato and didn't cause havoc"

"She said something like that is was getting really tough for them

 and technically we can all be leaders. Hang on

 they'd be able to undo people's flags if they were spam flags"

"You can edit a post by clicking the little pencil tool at the bottom of one of your posts. (If it doesn't work

 it looks great

 I think we are having a more ""blocky"" approach. The smooth corners are really hard to code"

 that's a pretty accurate description if what it should look like

shading/shining:

You can use a white/bright line to do some shining effects. That works ""‚Äî""

 I don't think we should do shading"

 let me think about that

Maybe it doesn't have to be a slider

 you just do the 2 arrows to adjust the hue."

@Healeybot1 I finally did it!"

"[@Healeybot1](http://google.com)

Hmm.<h>. Did you get tagged here?"

"Yeah.

 you *did* get tagged!?"

"Revive! Guys

 I made a black link:

Werid

"I think I figured out a way to tag fred<h>rick

(@anon45945411)

Got him Huzzah!!!!"

"I can tag fred<h>rick now! @AHappyCoder 

(@Fredrick)"

Huzzah! (@anon45945411) <ssjsjsjs>

What have you done <wssssss>

Right way to say it:

I don't really like you :wink:"

"Aw man :joy:

 I made a black link. I'll tag you"

"@AHappyCoder right above this posto

Oop you already saw this"

 ok :joy: <jnewjndwnjdejdj>"

Oh man :<h>o <knswnksnksknknn>

The ear-frying pan of exact doom :joy:

"What! Ok

 gotta look this up!

 if you create a sound loud enough

 it'll create a black hole b/c of the energy"

"Woah! That's pretty intense!

What if you used that to exterminate small tiny space dust. And covered the Space shuttle with something hmm"

"Oh duh

<sub>oooooooooooooop"

"test

teso

jnnt

hmm"

:joy: I'm gonna get banned for: Purposefully Breaking/Misusing the Forum

My brother is about to make a forum story topic or something

"I get that all the time :<h>/

If I watch something once my whole ""you might like this"" gets wrecked. It's really annoying AI isn't too good yet"

"Exactly. And then my parents come over and they are like

 ""Why are you watching this stuff""

(@anon4137737)

(@fork)

(@frock)

I've tagged the gang"

"Try tagging the OMTL

There is over 150 users on it

No one can be tagged

"The OMTL has reached its limit of 150 users

 and cannot be used to tag anyone anymore. Admins need to extend this limit in the settings. You may tag the OMTL all you want now

 because no one will be notified.

If you try to tag the OMTL

 a sign on the right pops up and tells you:

Warning! You mentioned @<You found the secret>OMTL

 however this group has more members than the administrator configured mention limit of 150 users. Nobody will be notified.

[details=Amazing Pictures by @claw33 that describes the situation XD]

![image|400x313](upload://guzXWKOHbIwPiRzD7EfgEyc1HEy.jpeg)

[details=Temporary Solution]

Remove users who haven't posted in over a year:

@celine           

[details=Second Solution]

We could use a spare group

 and if anyone wants to join the new OMTL

 they could

@Liza @AwesomeOnion @Rodrigo 

@POMTL @TheJonnyGamers

____

**News:**

OMTL IS BACK!!"

"If you make a new project

 you can tag them. I think"

 you are. It's all cool :ok_hand:"

 they were talking about depression

 coincidentally at the time Player was"

 there's too many people on OMTL tag list!

Game testers.... for everyone!

 I'll try and figure this out"

 this is weird stuff :<h>/"

"Strange

"There are a bunch of people on there who haven't been seen in years

Admins should just remove the people who haven't been seen in over a year"

"We'll just have to wait for Liza to change it

She might do it real quick"

Hehehe @OMTL we never thought this day would come :joy:

 uh oh :<h>/ Maybe not"

 that is what I was thinking

There is around 10 of them

I'll make a list and edit it above

 so if the temporary solution isn't enough

 we can push it to 6 months

 and then 3 or less"

Man oh man. I wonder if THT thought that this could happen. Oh well

 right :joy:

"I got flagged twice for spam on my own topic. Cool beans.

I'm not mad

 just a little disgruntled or something :<h>/

I would appreciate it if someone were to outright tell me to stop doing whatever I was doing instead of going straight to flags. I'll understand.

Let's go over what it means to flag something as spam:

Post is an advertisement

 something that is overly promotional in nature instead of being useful or relevant to the topic as expected.

 I'm just really confused as why my postos were considered an advertisement.

 you're fine bro!"

"Hehehehe now I have the alts üòÇ

Except you turned off your notifs"

That was a warm up for tomorrow üòè

 this topic is opened again

Let's stop the spam flags

Just tell someone if they are getting triggered or something

 this topic needs to be preserved. I guess.

 4 hours isn't too bad. We just don't want this topic to be completely shut down"

"Want to know how to make alts super quick?

I made like 80+ in 2 hours"

 I probably could've done that as well

 I was liking a few posts whenever I made an account

(I got this topic to 114 likes so yay) (except most of them were @SweepTheForum's üòÇ)

I'm gonna try to get it way up there

 we need a bunch of people working on making @FloodTheForum"

 ok. I got scared there while just making some more

 check in my gt for the list of all my accs"

Did you refresh the page? I had to do that

"Hmm. I just did them through 70

How about I do evens and you do odds"

Sweeet! üëå <jajajaj>"

And I have officially made my @100thAccountInADay

 because the OMTL has hit 150

 and you can't tag more than that in a single post. THT needs to lift the upper bound

 or we just shift to a new group as the new OMTL

üòÇ Sorry for breaking the Forum *again* (I may or may not have added a few alts on their to tip it over 150 :Joy: )"

Oh yeah! See you then üëå

"Theoretically

 I could like someone over 20K times üò±"

Hahahaha üòÇ I'm gonna do that right now

 I made 5 Xse accounts

 I made a ""how do you become leader?"" Topic with the ""how do you do it?"" üòÇ"

How to create alt accounts real quick:

When entering in your email addr<hi>ess in the ""sign up"" you can type in your actual email

 except with an extra period in it

 because g<hi>Mail overlooks periods

 but discourse doesn't.

testmail@gmai<hi>i.c<hi>om = test.mail@g<hi>mail.<hi>com

They act as 2 different emails to discourse

 but the Mail will be sent to the same account

I'll find the black text image and how it works. I just realized on iPad it looks wonky a little bit

 but on laptop

 it works. I'm gonna try and fix it up"

Haha üòÇ You're bringing up all my old postos

:eyes: I know what to do nooow.<hi>. Hehehe"

Hopscotch is dying out. (2017) Differences in 2018

"This topic needs to be BUMPED because this is still happening. It's gone on for a year now and no changes

 really. :<h>/

(Except for Game Changers

 they added some stuff to there)"

"Bug fixing?

 yeah. They've only don't bug fixing for the past year. The inky thing that's new is being able to draw and animate objects. Which is *super cool* if you have the subscription

Things I'd like them to implement:

Strings in text. I want to add text together to make custom paragraphs and stuff. Variables in the text would make that easier to code.

Layers. Ugh

 this neeeeds to be added. I simply despise the send to back and bring to front. Layers would act like a z-axis. If an object has a Layer = 1

 it is behind another object that has Layer = 3. Think of the cool stuff you could make using variables!

 I'm outa likes again."

Yeah exactly. There are so many ideas for Hopscotch Updates that would make the experience a whole lot better. And we'd be able to make more powerful code and better creations

"Oh man! That's another good one!

If you want to do it manually

 all you need to do is learn trigonometry

 and then you can make it with a few blocks. But a simple block like this would be reeeally easy to code! Oh well

I made a topic on this a while ago

 ideas for new blocks. Let me pull it up.<hi>."

 before I pull up the link

 here's an example of the way that projects are getting less .<hi>. Uh .<hi>. Well

Is this project in.<hi>.

(Play the app before you vote!)

- Rising

- Featured

 here's the topic. I didn't have regular at the time

 so HR moved it over and turned on a Global Edit:

"Bump

I'll add this:

>**Set Layer Block**

How it'll help: Now you can set the layer of an object without using the pesky ""send to back"" or ""bring to front"" bricks.

And @Stradyvarious's idea:

>**Turn object towards a certain point** 

How it helps: Now you don't need to know Trigonometry to be able to do this"

 I wish I knew how to actually code :<h>/"

"It's laggy

 there are bugs in the code

 I don't know how to play it

 the background could give someone epilepsy

 the game suddenly ends. It should've been in rising.

 this sounds harsh

 but I feel like it's an embarrassment for the community

 when new users want to be inspired and they see this. It doesn't show the true potential of what you can do with Hopscotch"

Yeah!! That'd be perfect!

 hey @Stradyvarious. I see you're on

 take a spy on this bug!

Polls. Because

I wonder if you are reading this posto ü§î

@BlastFusion do the polls look smaller than normal??

 right!? That's so interesting :thinking:

I used the same technique as the overlapping text glitch

"Poll with more options?? ü§î

Sooo cooool"

"Ooh! NASA might have some really neat ones!

I'm gonna check around"

"Aha

But this also gets real serious

I'm trying to formulate something since I see a few people are on here"

 here's some helpful advice hopefully

I get real scared when people talk about harming themselves :<h>(

If I'm every in an ultimate down gloomy mood

 I try to do something positive other wise I keep spiraling down and that's no good at all. It is unhealthy and

 well you know. You could drastically change your life :<h>/

I try to focus my mind on cool thingos and distract myself by doing sports/drawing/mathematics/video games and the like.

 if I'm in a super serious issue

 I just pray and read scripture. Its healthy just to let go of worries and pain

 and just relax and meditate. I am a Christian

 and if I weren't one

 I don't know what I'd do without God's help. Probably self harm

 there you go"

"I'm adding that as a tag üòÇ

Awesome! Let me check first

I just got 231 replies neato @OMTL

"I like the first test a lot

 the gradual zooming out looks really nice

(I wonder if there's a way to make it so that the ball doesn't go below screen whenever you zoom?)"

"I'm gonna play around with some of the variables in the code in a copy of the project

This is so cool!"

 I see how this works

The camera automatically adjusts to the middle

 and then readjusts. The reason the ball goes under the screen is because the flooring is a ractangle block

Wow! This is super swell!"

"Hehe I'm an interesting fellow I guess üòÇ

 @OMTL"

Sweeet! @OMTL @OMTL @OMTL

 it needs to be approved

 first"

"Idk I tried to do some stuff in a copy

I did notice that while moving in close up

 the ball would go back and forth (very quickly) now I changed it (in my copy) to just be static and the only background moves during the close up"

"Oh yeah! Same!

I earned ""basic"" with my Lisa account

 and it said that it was closed or removed. I couldn't post whatsoever or create any topics. Weird

"I'll screenshot the code

It has to do with the zoom variable"

I noticed that the zoom variable approaches 6 when zooming in

 so now when it gets greater than 5.5 it'll just set the position at center screen

![IMG_3280|333x250](upload://3oeyI5ZUf0vwbFPDPo9bMwJKi8b.jpg)"

"Don't forget COAN and Corvus!

They've been working like crazy

"It should

You can try out the project if you have time (it's the copied draft with JG in the title)"

"Oh yeah! I remember @oio

That was a while ago"

 it flicks a bit when moving while being zoomed in

 if that's what you were talking about

 ok"

I'll upload a video so you can see

"Cool üëå

 the copying from draft to draft is gonna be super amazing and make things way more efficient"

"Woah! Awesome!

"Wow! That's sweet!

 I believe it's called the terminal

"After over 4 years of coding

 I have finally figured out how to do the ""When Pressed"" technique. Yeeeees

I created a draft in there called button.

I have a few ideas for this

Edit: I added a couple of ideas in there"

"I'll just publish it

 since I have an interesting idea on there

""When pressed"" ideas:

I can now do ""when pressed for ___ milliseconds""

I have some interesting ideas now for games:

‚Ä¢ Actual Piano Tiles :<h>o (With those long tiles idk)

‚Ä¢ Automatic Rifle/SplatGun where you can hold it down and it automatically shoots for a certain amount of time

 and then it heats up and you have to wait before you can shoot again

‚Ä¢ Holding down on a door or something

 and it counts down ""3 ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ 2 ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ 1"" and then you enter it. This is interesting so now if you accidentally press something

 it doesn't activate anything.

‚Ä¢ Flic<h>k and shoot an object

‚Ä¢ Angry Birds aiming

‚Ä¢ Geometry dash airship!"

"News flash:

If you play geometry dash

 you're gonna be very happy with me

I just created the geometry dash airship game mode in HS!

It works *exactly* like in GD and it's smooth and everything

Hooray! Play it here:

 I saw that üòÇ <jsksksksksksksk>

You tagged me like 5 times

 too üòÇ"

 what are *you* talking about?"

 lists are great

 I hope HS implements them

Same thing with layers

 so then you could do a z-axis sort of deal without needing to use the pesky ""send to back"" and ""bring to front""s. Lists and Layers

 I was thinking the exact same thing

 where each ingredient represents a variable number. So then when you put 3 different ingredients together

 it adds their numbers together (ex 1.01 2.02 and 3.03) and makes a total number (6.06) and then if the combination = 6.06 it calls a soup combo.

 it'll require some math to figure out the spacing"

"There isn't a limit

 at least I don't think so

They must have removed it

I tried tagging loads of people

 and it didn't give me a warning message"

IT'S TIME TO STOP-alt accounts

"This is the second time someone has tagged me in a similar topic.

I have not used alts for mal intent purposes

 other people's have made the fake Xse accounts. Why would I instigate something when the whole ordeal started in my math topic and ruined it :<h>/ I despise Xse

Ahhhhhh! This was a kind of silly setting.

I just doubled it to 100. 

I think Disourse

 the company that built the forum software

 designed likes to be a way of agreeing with a poster. So

 instead of replying and saying ""yah!""

 they just want you to like. So

 they then wanted to prevent people from going on a spree and liking every post because that would make it less of a statement. Our forum is a little different though

 and people like a lot.

Still use ""like"" as a way of agreeing

 but agree with as many posts as you want.

Let's see how this goes!

And I still run out :joy:"

">## Bullyin<h>g

>----

> After what seemed like a forever of a long time

 Xse finally seemed to have backed off and given up on the Forum (At least

 I hope I don't jinx it uh oh).

 we have been getting some ""xse wannabe"" alternate accounts because apparently it's cool to trick people into thinking that you're the same person who called you some really innapropriate things. (I'll discuss more about this later)

>Besides the Xse situation

 the forum has been running pretty smoothly. We haven't had any major flame wars

 and we are all on decently good terms with each other (unless I am mistaken

 oop üò≥üòÇ)

>**References:**

Goodnight! <kdkfjrkdjiejdndnendnfnfH>

">## Forum Glitching

>One thing that I have noticed has disgruntled some people in the past month is the forum glitching. Thanks to my natural talents (and idk

 recklessness) I have figured out a few ways to glitchy the forum!

>[details=Topic Nuking]

>to pretty much ""nuke"" a topic. It pretty much closed the topic for good and made it pretty glitchy. I *did* receive some backlash in the form of a few topics (And I'll be discussing this later too

 on when to create a topic).

>Now in the middle of January

 we were sort of in a ""Cold War"" ""nuclear deal"" ""apocalypse"" mode. Anyone who got angry or silly could use the nukinf ability and create some serious damages.

 @William04GamerA and I reported this nuking glitch over to discourse and they fixed it. As of now

 there aren't any Forum threatening bugs

 but there still might be some out there

 who knows!

>[/details]

>List of Other serious glitches in Forum: 

> \- The destroying of the ""latest"" layout (fixed) (Yeah

 sorry about this one)

> \- Breaking the OMTL (fixed) (will mention this later)

> \- Overlapping Text and Glitchmoticons

> \- Alternate users being named as existing groups

> \- Many other interesting glitches

 but not *too* serious (Hehe

 poll within a poll üòÇ)

> \- **Speed Alt Creation** (Will talk about this later)

> \- @fredrick / (@fredrick)

>[details=Backlash]

>Boom chicka boom

 Ima talk a little bit about the backlash I've been getting on *accidentally* stumbling upon these glitches. üòÇ

>Hehe. Okeedokes

 I've been noticing a bunch of topics that basically rebuke me about these glitches. Some examples are: ""Hey

 I know that a topic very similar to this has already been made

 but I'm just gonna create a new one for some attention. Please stop glitching the Forum! Is this really necessary!""

>I will be discussing more about this in a moment. This is merely what I've observed

>In other words

 people aren't too happy with my forum glitching üòÇ

">## Community Leaders

>There's been some talk about community leaders and whether or not they should make a return. We are pretty split so far on whether or not

 most of us would say ""It depends"" but if given a choice of either yes or no

 75% of users agree that it might be a good idea to bring them back. 

>(If you want to catch up some more about this

 read the references below)

>[details=Pros]

>**1<h>. Quickly Fix Situations**

>Community Leaders would be active enough to fix situations at the start

>Example 1: Xse situation. He would get banned nearly immediately and would not get the chance to spread his innapropriate behavoir across the forum

>Example 2: When the OMTL tag list got full when it hit 150 users

 no one was able to tag it anymore. A Community Leader could've fixed that right away.

>**2<h>. Keep the Forum Running Smoothly**

>Community Leaders would be able to keep the forum running smoothly and easily keep things organized.

>Examples: They can create new categories

 merge topics together

 delete topics

 lock topics

 create groups

 edit groups

 undelete posts that were accidentally deleted

 edit any post

 remove any post

 unlist topics

 you name it. They can do a lot.

>--- 

>You get my point

 Leaders can do a lot and can keep the forum efficient. Now let's look at some cons

>[details=Cons]

>**1<h>. Constant Competition**

> There might be some real nasty competition between users about whether or not who would make a great leader. Flame wars ahead :<h>/

>If you have more cons

 please tell me

 thx

>Well

 now that we've discussed the pros and cons about Community Leaders you may or may not have shifted your view on whether or not we should bring them back.

>[details=How we can Bring Back the Leaders?]

>If we do want to bring them back

 how do we do it? The only way is to uniminously vote on it after lots of discussion

 and then respectfully email Liza and THT. They have the real power when it comes to electing leaders.

>If we want to elect leaders

 we should not choose on who we want to become a leader

 we should have THT choose

 if they even agree that they want Leaders back. This is because then whoever is the most popular should get the most votes

 and when someone asks

 would I make a good leader?"" no one is gonna disagree with you

 because that'd be considered rude.

>This has brought about the term

 ""False Positivity""

> It is where the truth may not be the best thing or most polite thing to say

 so you just say something ""positive"" or basically just agree with what the person is asking because it'll make them feel good and stay friends with them.

> **References:**

">## Forum Bill Passing

 here's a new idea that's been flowing around: Let's make some bills and pass them!

>I love this idea

 as it gets people to focus on bettering the Forum and thinking about how to improve it. However

 most of the changes that we want to make after passing a bill requires a leader to do it.

>How do I vote?

>As of now

 there isn't a specific topic on where to vote

 but you do need to be a Regular. I did have an idea on creating a topic where all of the pending bills would be listed.

>Can I submit a bill?

>Of course! All ideas are welcome üëå

">## Spam Liking

>@AHappyCoder and a few others have figured out a way to easily spam like someone really quick! This technique can help you really spam one of your friends! When paired with a new technique to easily create alternate accounts

 spam liking can become brutal! As in 1

000 likes in 10 to 15 minutes brutal! üòÇ

 some users aren't too keen on becoming spam liked. It just really isn't there thing. Even though they are racking up some likes

 it just isn't fun for them. Some of these people are getting angry at spam likers

 but fear no more!

>There is an old Forum trick to *not* get notified when someone likes one of your posts. Ask @AHappyCoder or some other users who've been around for a long time

 mostly because idk how to turn off the notifs myself üòÇ

>Have you noticed that some users have the same profile picture? No! Haha

 well it's really hard too because it's confusing üòÇ

>Some users (including myself) have participated in games where we all gather and load up the same profile picture. However

 it is not appropriate to use someone else's pfp without their permission.

>Users can get *very* angry when people impersonate them

 so always ask beforehand if you're allowed to use someone else's pfp (unless you're planning a surprise party or something

 and everyone is gonna be the same pfp at once and it'll be hilarious üòÇ)

">## Spam Flagging

>Now this is something that I hoped I wouldn't be hearing :<hey you found a secret>/ Apparently

 people are getting flagged for no apparent reason

 cuasing them to lose regular!

>Let's discuss on when to flag a post

>**You may Flag a Post when:**

> \- It is **completely** disrespect and innapropriate. Something that you would never say to someone else. Basically

 it is a completely uncivilized post.

> \- The poster is persisting to be off topic and spam<h>ming on purpose

 destroying the conversation that is taking place.

>[details=When to Flag a Post (cont)]

 these are just guidelines. Here are a few precautions to take before you whip out some flags. 

>Ask the user kindly to settle down / chill in a respectful way:

>""Hey bro

 I noticed that you are getting a little intensified right now. Just breathe a bit

 I don't want you getting flagged"" 

>or

>""Hey dudem

 that post isn't super helpful to the convo

 did you mean to post that?""

>or in certain cases

>""Hey

 I'm gonna be up front about this

 you are being pretty disrespectful. This is uncalled for

 I don't want you getting flagged""

>If a user is still disrespecting you after you respectfully confronted him

 then you have reason to flag their posts. But usually

 they'll understand and realize that what they are doing probably isn't the coolest in town.

>What we don't want is a user to be super flaggetized for something that they didn't realize that they were doing. We all need a wake up call sometimes. üëå

">## Alternate Account Speed Creation

>As of recently

 @NindroidGames and I have discovered easy ways to create alternate accounts *wicked quickly!!*

>The method that we are using allows us to created 2 to 3 accounts *per minute* using the same email add<h>ress. Pretty insane

 right!? (I might say it's a glitch

 but it is more of a method. Many websites allow you to take similar actions)

 we are getting some pretty decent backlashing from discovering this glitch/method (and creating well over 500 accounts within a week üòÇ)

>(The ironic part about it is that people are *creating* multiple new topics to tell us that we are *creating* too many accounts üòÇ)

>Creating alternate accounts is harmless

 unless used for bad intentions. Alt accounts are free for discourse

 they don't clog up space as multiple topics do

 and they are fun to spam like with üòÇ"

">## When to Create a Topic?

>Honestly

 this has been around for quite a while.  People have been creating topics left and right

 which is great

 but some of them could be put in gt's or other appropriate places.

>[details=Examples]

>Example 1: You have a really cool piece of art that you'd like to show the Forum. It's

 the coolest thing ever bro! What should you do? Create a new topic because it's so splendiforous? Or post it on the Official Drawing Topic?

>Example 2: You've been on the Forum for a month

 and it's time to celebrate! The forum is great! Should you

 create a topic because you've been on for a full month

 or have an epic bo snazzy party on your general topic?

>Example 3: You're fessed up about something that's happening and others are too. However

 you see that they've already created a topic well describing the situation! Should you

 create your own topic

 because you can do it better

 and you like the attention

 oooor

 agree with the other user's topic and add to the discussion?

>I don't want answers to the questions in the examples

 I just want you to think about them.

>One reason why we'd like Community a Leaders back is that they can merge topic together. How cool is that! It keeps things organized

 and it's pretty slick.

time itself is an illusion

It totally is

 our brains are the things that perceive time

If there is an alien species out there

 they may perceive time in their brain differently

In the 4th dimension

 time is totally changeable and can be moved through

 as if it were another way to say ""up and down""

There's like 26 or something dimensions that exist

 I recommend reading a book called

 ""Hyperspace"" by some guy I'll pull up a link"

I wanna do some one on one talking here

 if that be alright

I know that you want to help everyone

 that's an awesome quality to have

 and makes some great leadership üëå

I did notice that there were some triggering times back up on the mental awareness topic

If anyone is seriously bugging you like that

 they aren't worth your time. Just say

 ""Adios bro

 mighty fine convo

 or something""

But you don't want to send the triggers right back

 catch my drifto?

Lastly of all

 I really do appreciate that you care about everyone here. That is a Christian like quality üëç There is a time however

 that it is appropriate to back off from a convo. Sometimes

 people aren't ready to hear the answers (I know that doesn't make sense

 but some people are going through some pretty rough emotional struggles. They just need some friends and people to talk with and supporters)

I feel like all of us can work on this"

"Yeah. I really have mixed issues on that topic. I really don't enjoy going there since people are just talking about all the rough things and it's real overwhelming. We aren't mental counselors

 we are just kiddos help

 topic:39697""]

*worry*

 it's the worrying part that gets me. There are too many people on here to worry for

 your just gonna get tired

 (like you already said) and have an emotional breakdown (Those aren't fun)

You don't have to worry about every little thing

This is on reason why I'm a Christian

 because I don't need to worry

 I can put it on God

 and go with the he flow

That doesn't mean I care about nothing. I care about everything

 if I see that I can help someone

 I go right at it. But as soon as I can tell that things aren't working

 I just back off and rethink about what's happening and think about how the person you are trying to help is feeling."

 that is exactly how I feel

But sometimes acting out immediately isn't the best thing

Just have some thoughts and a swifty easy convo and be real chill to see where they are coming from

Science has proven that when any statement (even if correct) is told to someone

 but even witn the tiniest hint of ""You're wrong"" in it

 the person's brain with mentally block the message or challenge it. It's a weird thing

The best way is to lay low and be real chill and be unnoticeable and as kind as possible

We do not hate the espresso machine

 you're probably a really chill person

It's just a little annoying when you tell people whether or not the topic was good

 pretty much the same level of annoyance as some of those unneeded topic

 which is why some people are disgruntled

the mess the forum is in

Did you happen to see the xse situation? That was a doosey

Did you happen to see the nuke situation? That was a doosey

 how much have you missed?? That's key to understanding a whole bunch of stuff

I created a ""State of the Forum 2018"" topic

 I'll fetch a link"

We knew it

Didn't we avocado

@Avocado"

I heard from a little avocado that you were gonna super roast me with yasumac??

 nindroid was being nindroid

Nindroid isn't rude to people like that

 besides he joined in 2015 when espresso said they joined in 2016

Nindroid is a nindorid

 and that's what he is"

Espresso is an alt

Through process of elimination

 espresso could be:

weathercats

tacocode"

"Here is the exact post:

I believe there are more"

"@lollypopcorn 

 cookie topics shouldn't be allowed

(That's why we need leaders back so that they can merge topics together)

But we shouldn't go upfront and tell them

 ""This topic is stup<hi>id

 unneeded

 or SBYP""

I've had that happen to me

 where I spend a while on creating a topic

 and then people just say SBYP

It's really annoying

 it makes you feel kind of sad after all that hard work

 and they aren't contributing to the topic

What we need to do is to respectfully and kindly approach people and help them work it out. We have no idea what anyone else is thinking on the forum or how they are feeling

I'm still trying to find that post by Liza. I need some help"

possibly: weathercats

I think it could be weathercats

 tacocode

 or xse"

"Lol okeedokes

"I know right :joy:

He started weirding things up back in may

 and then t1 suspended him when she was still around

Then in november or something his ban was lifted and he didn't change

 I hope he never comes back"

"Hehe thanks :joy:

The first image is just the drawing concept image"

Ugh he makes me so mad xse does sniffer sniff"

I'm gonna try to make it neat and tidy

It'll be cool though when I publish it

 it's sorta like a 3d game

 but it's isometric so it's not true 3d graphics"

That is very true oh well :<H>/

I'm gonna have to create my own sprites for this game too

I can't seem to rip any online hmm"

"Sprites are a word for characters/objects in le codes

I'm gonna try to have them animated too"

"Thanks! Gtg see you around :ok_hand:

<sub> <sub> I'll be back later tonight"

Hehehehehehehe I better did so hello <jsjsjsj>

"Dookkie dookkie

They never see it coming and I pull it out when they least expect it :eyes:"

Yeeeeah!L yeeyeyeyeyYaahahahah!"

 Not is not me lol üòÇ"

"Oh <dd I'm still pretty happy!!>

So when do we make our speechers?? ü§î"

Fudge sauce and apple sauce)

Drop de doodle do! What should a Friendly Neighborhood detective doo?? Hmm now that is a sticker. Detectives should stay around on the forum and help people out. They should keep the forum an awesome and enjoyable place to be

 and spy around for any sneaky critters!

Some ideas I have for the forum

Keep the forum an overall fun place to be üòÑ It is already fun

 but can we make it even more spiffy ü§î I have an idea of a forum game

 but I'd need to think about it some more

Any major issues?

 there hasn't been too many major issues recently. There's been Xse

 forum nuking (hehe sorry)

 and alternate accounts <sub> <sup> (hehe)

Stopping the issues

The best ways to approach anything is with respect

 kindness

 and being empathetic. This means that we should all care about what each other thinks. If we all did this

 the world would be a better place. We can all be a leader on the forum :+1:

Favorite projecto on Le Hopscotch?

 I'm gonna have to go for COAN's 3d app

 just because it's the most fascinating thing out there. Super de duper! üòÑ

More about me

I joined the Hoperscotcher in 2013

 I run Super Mario Mini Games with my younger bro town

Even more about me

One time A Happy Coder spam liked me

 I'm hacking coans app and learning how it works :joy:

Gotta make a 3d mario game"

Lol it wasn't me it was on Global Edit lol

"Yeeees! Just simplified my isometric game code! No more laggity!

Now I can work on camera angle so it can be a true 3d game yeeees

I know who Sam is

 I'm pretty sad and disappointed at the same time

What has this forum become

Don't tell anyone I know"

Are you saying you want a spam likem ü§î

"Watching the Olympics with family

But now I'm on aaaaall night boyos!! üòÑ"

"Hehehehehehehe are you suuure ü§îü§îüòÇ

When everyone is on and when you get on everyone isn't on lol

Hi! lol it's season 2 hooray! üòÑ

Yo bro? Wassup wassup wassup my dudem üòÑ

"I saw

You leaving hs?

Why

 your projectos are amazing!

Ooh you should learn python"

hehe <kskskskwkskskskkskaskks>

"Oh I did my math wrong

I thought it was 2499 oopy dudem"

 it's about le subscription

My first two features didn't have images in them

Flappymoji

 my first feature

 used emoji pixel art

(But I agree

 having the subscription gives your projectos a little more umph)

(But do remember

 COAN's 3d game is without the subscription)

(Lol idk if he has it)

I'm working on an isometric RPG game

 and I'm debating on making it a Mario game or not (I wanna play with the animations)

All in all

 once you learn some super maths

 coding becomes a lot easier

Algebra

 Geometry

 and especially trig help a lot

I can't wait to add some calculus math soon!

I'm learning it and it's wicked awesome! üòÑ

 what are you talking about üòÇ You have a game changer and I don't lol. Only 7 game Changers use the subscription. The others are ultra creative as well."

Oh yeah! I'm super stooooked! Drop de doodle do it's party time! Lol

"I know right üòÇ

Gotta get 333 postos one day then üòÑ"

"Those were my younger Bros game Changers

Hehe he's ahead of me 2 - 0 lol"

"Only with one little thing like

 it was wicked minor he might've not used it in the game

He worked on those two projects by himself

 I only gave him some level ideas

 the code was purely his

Pretty insane

 right! I was blown away with his work"

 photos is pretty wicked slickity flast hehe

Oop! I only have a few likes left more today

How should I use em ü§îü§îü§î"

Congrats on a 1/4 my dudem!! üòÑ

 glitch around with the Forum 

Lol okeedokers! Got it üëåüòÑ

"Heheheheh I have you now

 @asha lol üòÇ"

That's mostly because I disgruntled the forum or so

Examples

Nukes: nuke topics hehehehe people didn't like that lol (this actually got like 3 topics worth of backlash lol üòÇ)

Glitch around with the forum layout: hehehe some people got real angry

Alt accounts: Idk why people got upset with this one

Heheh the alt accounts was the most hilarious because people were creating a bunch of topics like

 ""Your clogging up the forum!"" 

And it's like

 well I guess you are too since you made a topic that had exactly the same thing as 5 others lol

Idk Ima detective :male_detective:"

"I nominate it foooor

Oh yeah! You went to le Disney üòÑüëå

Drop de doodle doo it's nearly the weekend time! Hooray!"

Now y'all know what's happening in my brain follicles and stuff üòÇüïµÔ∏è"

"Yeah that makes sense

Silly Xse wannabes

 I bet they don't even know what he did"

Oooh hello it's a sneaky topic lol

"Goodnight! So you later!

Season 222222!! üòÑ"

Wooooah! That's incredible! Wowowowowo!

"Sorry I'm outa likems

This whole ordeal started way back in May even before you joined

In May

 t1 and I were building up the maths topic

 when this dude named Xse comes on and starts talking some high level math

And then he starts bu<h>llying people saying that they are stu<h>pid

 and swearing at them. And this goes on for a few weeks and then t1 bans him

Once Xse's ban is lifted

 t1 has left

 so he decides to cause chaos on the forum by doing the acts that I've listed in these topics:

"I'd say that he was the worst bully that I've ever seen on the forum

 and I guess that's saying much since I've been on since 2015

If there is anything a user could do that would be absolute terrible and terrifying

 it is almost certain that Xse has done it"

"T1 deleted most of them to clean things up

 but here's a link:

This wasn't the only topic he targeted

 this was his first one. The stuff he did/said in here is mild compared to the stuff he did afterwards

 thanks üòÑ

 I still draw mazes

 I'm working on getting into a faire with a big 4' by 4' one I'm excited ü§ó

Keep at it! The more practice you have on it

 the better you get"

"In what definition for you would be the worst then? I'm ultimately confused

He broke every single community guideline

 and then some"

"T1 deleted the posts since they were truly terrifying

He was calling people ""autistic"" in a derogatory way

And he also called people with autism not human

 saying that they also deserved to die and stuff because of their bad DNA

 or so he said

That is just one minor detail of the vast stuff that he did

 and he posted the autism nonsense many times

 while targeting users

I'd say that isn't controversial

 but just plain uncivilized and immature"

"I'm outa the likems!!

 I'm not

 I'm American

That character is the widest character in Unicode

I broke/glitched a bunch of stuff on the forum with it

I broke the user cards

 which is why it's still in my user card (discourse fixed it

And before that

 I wrote 20 of them in a tag

 and it totally destroyed the layout of the ""latest"" section on the forum

It's just a memorial now üòÑ

I think it's the ending of a prayer in Arabic or something hmm"

"Ooh! I'll post a pic since Discourse fixed those bugs

It was truly hilariously crazy! Wowow"

 Okeedokers

So I'm still trying to find the screenshot I took aw man I take too many photos

Since it's such a long character

 it made the ""latest"" section look very different hmmhmhmhm where is that screenshot"

"Hehe I've always wanted to read that book

The Hopscotchers Guide to the Galactical work of coding"

There should be a tutorial mode

 I didn't really know how to do anything except for move and it was great!

I love the idea

 I feel like you could totally take this super far and add to this spiffy game

How do you mine/grab stuff

I sorta figured out how to craft

 but I didn't have the ingredients so Ima look at it again"

"Wooooah! That's a whole bunch of them!

I used to have a few thousand

 and now I have 2

200 because I got a different device"

"Oh isn't that nice

 lol üòÇ"

"Awesome! That'd be super spiffy

Aw man I'm outa the likems D:"

"Well here we go

I'm a bit sleepy so gn everybody bye"

 @Not I see you've found the super posto üòÇ"

How did oh knowoowowwo :<h-)o"

"Thanks so much dude!! This projecto was my younger brothers

Hehehehehehehe it's seeason 2 boyos! üòÑ

I don't think I am :thinking: hhmhmhm is it an alt? What is it?

Thanks bro! It's season 2 :smile:

Thank you! My younger brother coded it himself! Wowowow

"Yeah! You totally could do it

If you create more levels it totally would!"

"Hehe that's me 

FloodTheForum!! 

I'm up to: @FloodTheForum207"

"yeeeess?? Hmmmm

"Ooooh sounds interesting

Whatcha working on

Oohohohphp I know exactly what it is! Lol jk

"He replied on the same day

How did you know to find this topic after 6 days ü§î

Plus people search their name in the search bar all the time

And also check the ""latest"""

"Hmhmhmhmhm hi hi hello gonna get to 250 today

Gonna try and get 250 postos per day

 so we can get a 10k in 40 days"

CodingHorror kind of got all mad at me when I was reporting some issues

 he was all like

 ""if we catch any users doing this we'lol just ban them""

And this other dude roasted me on there lol

I was just reporting a bug üòÇ"

 I even did a pm with some big guys at discourse about the Xse issue

 and they started making weird references about cars and car manufacturers

They said

 if the mods of the Forum are having an issue

 they can contact us

But they just weren't getting it

 I was trying to tell them that the mods weren't active and Xse was making alternate accounts quite a bit

Good thing it died down though

Would you like to join le Hopscotch groupy chat üòÇ"

 that'd be real sweet

Or you could do invert colors

 but dark mode would be better"

 I kind of felt all sad after that but oh well

I even showed them the link of all of the misdemeanors that Xse committed and they just didn't really care oh well"

 I don't really know

I was asking them to remove this user because they were compromising the innocence of a *kids* coding forum

 but they didn't really care

 the only thing they did actually care about was the topic nuking

 the tag nuking (breaking the forum layout) 

 and breaking the 15 character title limit."

Feature: View all Variables While Project is Running

"One particular coding feature in all programming languages is the ability to view your variables while a project is running.

Lets say I have a variable called

 ""Count"" and every time I tapped the screen

 ""count"" was increased by 1

Instead of coding a new block to show the value of ""Count"" it would be amazing to pull up a little side bar while the project is running which shows the list of all variables and what value they are at.

This is just one example

 if you have multiple variables running at once

 having a feature like this would be incredible. Then you can keep track of all your variables while running your project. When programming complex projects

 a feature like this would be key.

Thanks! :smile:

Aw man-yaygirls 

Whyyyy hyyyyy whyyyy whyyyy 

This is what happens when people get into fights and arguments online. Wow. Whoever was fighting think twice about what to say or do-@BlueStarGirl also I believe in LGBT but im not exactly it myself

Prepare yourself for a rant under the cut -ChickenGirl

[details=""Feel free to add to this or correct typos I was a tad enraged when I wrote it""]

Ok wow this topic is a mess. 

What I'm gathering here is that @Bright_Light is complaining straight people don't have a place to talk about their problems. False. Straight people make up the majority of the population

 and they are not bullied

 are not abused

 are not attacked ki.lled or discriminated against BECaUSE of their sexuality. Absolutely no one is saying you can't have problems if your straight. 

What you're talking about

 not having a safe space to share about your abuse is an entirely different set of circumstances. It is absolutely awful that you were abused and I'm truly sorry

 but you weren't abused because you were straight. There are safe spaces out there for victims of abuse

 which you can go to or make if you want. 

The key word here is safe space

 which is what this topic is. This topic is a safe place to shelter LGBT+ kids whose problems and experiences directly relate to that they are LGBT+. Straight people do not need a safe space

 there's no massive heterophibia making them feel unwelcome anywhere. There is a large amount of discrimination towards the LGBT+ community in the world

 which is why this topic exists. 

This is a place to make people feel comfortable and safe

 to make the

 know that this is a place where they can share their true selves and feel accepted for it. Because the sad truth is that some of them don't feel welcome to come out in their own homes or schools. That is why this exists. And

 if you are straight and an ally

 you are free to come here as I told you before. 

But you are disturbing the peace. You are talking this safe space and stirring up trouble. You are comp

aiming

 in essence that this ONE thing isn't for you and your problems. 

I think it su.cks that you were in an abusive relationship. I think it su.cks that there are people in your school who don't have help for things like that. But that is another issue entirely separate from LGBT+ plus issues. 

Anyone of any orientation can be abused

 which is the sad truth of it. But saying that you think there should be a ‚Äústraight people topic‚Äù

wining that you don't have a place to talk about things pertaining specifically to being straight is problematic behavior

 and you're causing a whole bunch of unnecessary stress for everyone on here who just wants a calm respite from their problems. 

We're not devaluing your problems because you're straight

 everyone has problems. But this is a place to talk about our problems specifically

 and to learn more and teach. The straight people topic you want? That's the entire world. 

You say that they don't teach you about bout straight things in school they teach you what to do I feel you're bullied for your sexuality. You wanna know why. Because people are bullied for their sexuality. It's important that they teach you and bout LGBT+ relationships and things. It's important that's they teach that those things are normal. Because some kids could go their entire live show thinking something's wrong with them or that they are the problem for being LGBT if they haven't been shown it's ok and exactly what it is. They don't NEED to teach about heterosexuality in school because straight representation is literally all over the media. 

If you want an abuse topic make it

 that would be a useful contribution. But don't go sniveling about how there is no place for you in the world when you've never experienced the hate some of us have and millions of LGBT+ across the world have just for who they love. That's just disrespectful. 

I've tried to make you welcome

 and other people have tried to be polite

 but you're arguing a point that doesn't need to be made

 and eventually there's a line. So if you can calm down and want to stay on this topic to learn about how to become the best ally you can then please

 be my guest. I've said as much in a post a while ago

 but apparently you can't read because I'm here having to read through this bs.

@ChickenGirl Wow that‚Äôs a lot o type wow! Awesome!

I don‚Äôt believe in LGBT

 but I do believe that we should all show love and kindness to one another and respect each other. Bull<dhdhdh>ying and mistreating people is the worst possible way to do things. :<secret message>/

üëÜExactly. You don't have to understand LGBT+ people's choices

 but you can respect them and be kind about it :) -CG

hhh the topic closed again???  I was out of the house and didn't have the chance to finish *epic rant*

[details=Message by BrightLight]

@ChickenGirl actually I‚Äôm perfectly capable of reading! Thanks! And how do u know I haven‚Äôt experience hate? Making assumptions I see. And ur telling me to calm down when ur the one going on a rampage. Also

 u can‚Äôt tell me that I can‚Äôt be on this topic. Last I checked

 it‚Äôs a topic on a public coding forum. I‚Äôm allowed to go on. I‚Äôm allowed to say my point of view. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt support lgbtq rights but I think so much of the focus has been on them and not on regular kids . A lot of kids at my school agree also so that tells u something. And being an ‚Äúally‚Äù means ur basically a friend to a lgbtq person but we clearly aren‚Äôt friends bc u got anger issues and ur going off on a different subject. And u claim they don‚Äôt need to teach about heterosexuality but I would actually appreciate learning abt it bc we rly haven‚Äôt been taught much. I already know a ton abt lgbtq which I don‚Äôt care abt bc I‚Äôm straight. how come I‚Äôm not allowed to have a place to talk? I don‚Äôt feel safe around y‚Äôall bc y‚Äôall attack me bc of my beliefs. I need a safe space . You can‚Äôt say that I can‚Äôt make one bc y‚Äôall can make ‚Äúsafe spaces‚Äù whenever u want

[details=Message from CG""]

You bring up some very interesting points :) 

Let me break it down for you.

Between 2007 and 2015 there were a total of 0.5% gay characters

 0.2% lesbian characters

 and 0.1% bisexuals. This isn't what I mean when I say there isn't a lot of LGBT representation. 

I don't think i understamd what you want to know about heterosexuality. That it exists? Are the mainstreaming media sources flooded with straight content not explaining things to you?

I'm sorry I got rather heated above

 but I would like to try and see things from your perspective a little.

Have people made fun of you in the past for being straight? Or are you afraid they might because its happened in the past to others?

We aren't saying you can't  have a problem place to talk. We're saying this isnt YOUR place to talk. This is ours to share our experiences.

You can make a place to talk if that's all you want.

It comes off as if you're attacking us

 blaming us for you somehow not finding a place to talk about your problems. I am not saying that problems you have aren't serious. Im not saying you don't need a place to talk about them. All problems are problems

Being an ally means you fully support the community

 and being an good all you means you don't tear the

 down anemic help them. It is awesome you are an ally. Answer that your friends are. This generation is actually the most acceptong of lgbt people and i think that's completely awesome! 

But you are blaming us instead of seeking us and being active in your own attempt to solve your problems or vent about them. I'd love to have an intellectua

 polite conversation with you now that I've  calmed down :)

Edit: and i must reitirate

 im terribly sorry that' you feel the focus hasn't been on LGBT problems

 but that is also because straight peoples problems don't pertain to the fact that they are straight. There's is a big issue with discrimination against LGBT people

 and that isn't why it needs awareness

 which it is getting more now then it ever has. I gtg eat dinner now

 love to talk later :)

Hypothetical Situation-

Say there's  group of apples and a group of oranges. Now there's are some bad apples

 some good apples

 and the same with oranges. The problem is that the apples are everywhere

 and they hate the oranges

 for no reason other than they are different. They purposefully exclude oranges from plays and books and movies

 filling those with apples instead. They harass and mock and sometimes ki.ll the oranges. Now

not all apples do this. But enough do anemic enough are quiet that the oranges have to hide themselves

 paint themselves to fit in. At one point

 after hundreds of years of this

 oranges starte to decide thats not ok. Most apples agree. There is a campaigns now

 there are oranges and apples working together to solve the problem. Oranges aren't more accepted then ever. But still ostracized. There's little to no content for them

 and most apples simply pretend they don't exist. Things are better

 but not good. There are still apples who violently hate oranges. The apples are still the societal norm. The thing is

 with this big movement for orange rights

 the apples who previously had the world to the

selves get mad. They say ""why isn't this for me anymore!"" ""I mean

  support orange so and all

 it do they have to get these things? Isn't it obnoxious for them to have so much?"" Apples still have just as much for them as before. But they don't see it that way anymore. If they can't have it all

 hey think they don't have anything. They'd forget that for so long the year had everything

 and oranges lived in fear

 painted themselves to fit in. The apples get mad now

 mad that someone's that's not them has a problem that's getting fixed. The apple still have problems. Big ones

 little ones. But because society is working to fix a big one that they'd caused

 they think they are being pushed aside.

Sound familiar? It should.

Problems and solutions on Hopscotch and the Forum

"There are way too many projects to sift through them all

26 million to be exact

 it's just insanely crazy

I just had an idea

 what if the ""newest"" section was sorted into 3 bits:

Newest Remixed Projects (all art goes here b/c it's remixed)

Newest Projects with less than 100 lines of code

New Projects with 100+ lines of code

 but I guess that's why we have follows

So then we can see some good apps"

 but it would sift out the majority of the art drawn by others"

suspending

Oh woah <thats a bit much woah>"

"Hmm I have a few ideas to do some recategorizing

Ima create a topic soon after I sort out some ideas"

 it's not too much of a big deal"

"I'm assuming it's a rounding bug

When 999

500+ posts are read

 it rounds up to 1000k

And when it finally hits 1000k

 it'll switch to 1.0M

Interesting ü§î"

"I saw that

 it's quite a bit! Woah

Only 1 month behind the founders

Wow anonymous is on meta with his old pfp

2016 memories"

"Hehe oop

Oh wow I remember @Stampys_fans that was a while ago

<sup>Now I'll read all the old 2016 posts"

"I'd learn Python and JavaScript since I'm too old for Hopscotch anyway

<sup>I'm in high school maybe it's time <sup> (only after I do this one app) <sup> (then I'll learn 3d matrices and physics)

 there's nothing we can do about it

I guess that's why we have the forum

 so then most people who actually care about HS come on here and share projects and ideas and whatnot"

"Haha yep

Remember when you could put in anything in the filler bracket

(I think they changed that super recently)

No I'm gonna look!

I figured out how to put anything in the filler bracket by typing:

<\!--  (Filler stuff!?!.."".' üëå)  -->"

 it's HTML

I found it on an html site that has a list of all of the fancy things:

 I got a like from Mr. Discourse Guy on the meta

And he also replied with a nice comment

Now I'm happy :<h>)

<sub> thankful it wasn't a post about weird references about cars and car dealerships

I gotta show you those posts lol"

"Yeah pretty much lol

Where is that pm

I'm wondering if he deleted it oh man!"

"This is like calling Ford to complain that a Ford Fiesta hit your car. You need to talk to the *owner* of that Ford Fiesta

 not Ford Motor Company.

If they are a car

 we are like the car dealership. We can tell the owners how to operate the car

 assist the owner in fixing the car when it breaks down

 maybe even sell the owner on a newer model of car ‚Ä¶ but if you have an issue with the way the car is being driven

 that needs to be taken up with the owners.

If the owners contact us directly we‚Äôd be happy to help them of course.

 I suggest flagging any inappropriate posts so they can be handled by the site owners / staff

 and used as evidence."

 I guess that wasn't as interesting as I remembered it

I guess I was all angry that Xse was making alts and stuff that I couldn't think straight or something"

He received 10 likes on that post though üòÇ What

 that makes sense üòÇ

I was super bewildered that he really didn't want to help

I feel like we are a disregarded corner of dicrouse

 but one that is still somehow active. The only active discourse forums I've seen are the Meta and this one

I found a list of all of them somewhere

(The Mr discourse dude also has his own forum for a blog site that he writes)"

I wonder how many forums are like this

A forum consisting of kids

 running the site on there own

Unheard of wow

Quite remarkable if you think about it

 actually"

"Sam lol

 the same sort of sleep where you can have a low level conversation

 but still be asleep and not remember it later"

 very disorienting

I have this mini bedside table right next to my head

 and sometimes in my sleep I'd lift my hard and drop it right on the corner on the table. It'd wake me up and was pretty painful ouchie :<h>/"

"That's happened to me

 the Hopscotch notifs don't load correctly

 it's weird

They've never really loaded correctly ü§î"

 those are the worst because it seems like such a good idea but then it turns out to be nothing at all üòÇ

And then there's dreams where I think it isn't a dream and I'm pretty happy because I did something and then I wake up. Usually it's something totally random and when I wake up

 I usually think

 ""Oh

 that was a little odd"" but in the dream it feels totally realistic and normal"

The answer on the multiple choice was a typo ok

"Ooh pine trees üòÇ

One time I had a dream I was in a big golf ball sort of dome

"(Yeah

 school worksheets can have a bunch of errors on them)

It's always interesting when the answer is displayed twice on a multiple choice question üòÇ Maybe it's a test to see if your paying attention I don't know

I still can't get over the fact that workse is blocked (workse)

What even is it üòÇ Just a misspelling of worksheet"

"That reminds me of the kendamas

In my middle school a few years ago they all brought yo yos

Hehe yo-yos are super tricky

Idk how people get so good at them"

"Has anyone ever had a dream within a dream

It's so confusing when you wake up

 but your still in a dream

It's only happened to me once

 I don't even know

I got up after a dream and it was time to get ready for school

 but I was living in Minnesota still and I couldn't find the door to leave the house"

"That's great üòÇ

">## Alternate Accounts

 this still has been a bit of a buzz lately. With the discovery of easily creating many alternate accounts back in January

 some users have created some interesting ideas.

 and it is as irritating as ever.

>If you see an Xse wannabe

 or any new account acting odd:

>\- Keep a careful eye on them :eyes: but be polite and welcoming

>\- If the user continues making mean/inappropriate statements

 flag away. It's a troll

>\- If the user is making multiple topics

 just ignore them and put the topic in ""Random Stuff"" or ""Lounge""

>It's **super** tough to determine whether or not a user is an alternate account or not. Here are some easy ways to tell:

>\- User creates a General Topic as their first topic

>\- User doesn't ask for help or any tips to navigate the forum (They seem advanced)"

"yoyoyoyoy ima lil busy rn

@Espresso.Machine"

">## Espresso.Machine & Sam Accounts

>Welp

 over the course of the month

 we've come across a couple of *interesting* alternates. Here's an overview of them

 and why they were made.

>[details=Espresso.Machine Overview]

>@Espresso.Machine is an account which was created on Jan 24. It was pretty unknown

>This new user laid low until February 17th when they suddenly came out and started critiquing people's topics. It was rather annoying and didn't contribute to the conversation whatsoever. A post of this type would look like:

>>The espresso machine has spoken: This topic is approved

>>The espresso machine has spoken: This topic is disapproved. Reason: Unnecessary

>We soon learned later that this user had

 ""Came back from a hiatus and saw that the HS forum was a mess"" so they decided to put it upon themselves to

 ""fix the [so called] mess"". Apparently

 they thought that 2016 was the golden year.

>The espresso machine also gave away 3 hints as to which account they used beforeL

>\- Joined during 2016

>\- Became inactive on November 2017

>\- Recently checked up on the forum and created the espresso machine account

>Due to process of elimination

 the only users to fit the requirements were: Tacocode and Weathercats

>More Theories: Some users believed that Espresso was either @NindroidGames or @JonnyGamer

 but since espresso showed an obvious dislike to us

 it didn't seem very plausible. Except for the fact that Nindroid combined his votes and Espressos votes in the HS election together

 which seemed suspicious.

>[details=Sam Overview]

 which was an obvious red flag that they were an Xse wannabe.

>The next day

 this Sam user started swearing and spam creating topics showing an obvious dislike of @NindroidGames. They also spam tagged the OMTL and Nindroid groups

 (Both with 250+ users in each) while swearing and etc.

>Many emails were immediately written to THT and the Sam user was banned for 1000 years (The only other user to be banned for that long is @OneHalfBath)

>Note: The Sam user attack was pretty comical (amidst the swearing)

 as their try at taking the forum seemed pretty weak

 which brought some hilarious roasts

 almost as if it were planned.

>**Espresso.Machine**

>Reason for Creation: Upset about the apparent messy state of the forum

>**Sam**

>Reason for Creation: Just a troll"

">## Spam Tagging

>During the Sam attack

 we found a weakness to gigantic user groups.

>Troll accounts are able to tag hundreds of users multiple times within seconds. How annoying is that!?

>What we can do:

>Remove ourselves from these massive groups

>What THT or Discourse can do:

>\- Users with Trust Level 1 cannot tag any groups with 250+ users (or only once per day)

>\- Massive Groups cannot be tagged more than once within the same topic (or only once per week)

>\- If a post with a tag is flagged

 the tag becomes cancelled and no notifications are recieved"

">## Nominations for Featured 2

> The original Nominations for Featured topic had finally hit 10 thousand posts as of February. Wow! That was one amazing topic!

>This reminds me

 I've heard around that people have noticed that the quality of featured projects aren't what they used to me. To be brutally honest

 some of them aren't exactly fun to play or are innovative or push the boundaries of Hopscotch.

>This is because THT has decided to give newer or lesser experienced users a chance at getting Featured. When I was younger

 being Featured was a huge honor. These new and less experienced users feel the same way

 and it's hard to compete when we've got COAN out making 3D projects üòÇ

>It took me a while to finally understand

 Hopscotch isn't about getting Featured or whatever. THT and the curators get to choose what gets put on there. Hopscotch was made so that you

 can be inspired to code

 and push yourself to be creative and invent new ideas. Hopscotch is like the starting platform or training wheels to your coding life. Once you get the hang of it

 you can start to take off those training wheels and ride off into the big ol world and explore the true possibilities. It does take hard work and effort to get to this level

 but Hopscotch makes it much easier to get there."

">## When to Create a Forum Topic

> Bouncing off of @Espresso.Machine

 when *is* it appropriate to make a new topic. According to them

 the forum is messy and jumbled up with many unneeded topics.

> I wouldn't consider the forum a messy place

 but some topics are a little annoying or unnecessary. But we need to ad<h>dress people with kindness about their topics.

>For example

 let's say you've been working on a topic idea for a while now

 and you've spent a good time working on it. You're hoping that an awesome discussion will take place and whatnot. Once you post it

 you go out for a couple hours and come back to see what's happened. You see a few replies

 but as you read them

 they just say ""SBYP"". You have no idea what you did wrong.

>Pretty disgruntling

 isn't it? Seems a little rude for something like that to happen. Maybe it doesn't altogether happen exactly 100% the way I wrote it

 but I have seen multiple instances where a user posts something

 and they get the ""SBYP"" without any responses to improve upon their topic.

>I don't know

 it's just something to think about"

">## The State of the Forum over the years

> Something that I thought could be an interesting idea is a Hopscotch Timeline

 a Hopscotch Forum Timeline

 or the complete histories of Hopscotch. It'd be nice to have something like this somewhere

 so users could look back and see what HS was like so many years ago.

>It'd consist of stories

 screenshots

 lists of famous innovative projects and users and the like.

>This needs to be a topic

 I've suddenly got a whole bunch of ideas

>Respond below what you think of it

>I guess why that's one of the reasons why I've been creating these topics

 to keep some sort of history

 and also inform people about what's been popping for the past month in a formal way (This is the most formal I've been for a whole month wow)

>Yeah

> I've written down 107 different Hopscotch loading screens

 and I'm wondering if there are any more."

Idk why there's a character per line limit. It makes no sense oh well"

 Hopscotch is Turing complete so you can do pretty much anything with it given enough time and the right code) (And the use of Unicode characters help a lot)

I really like the smoke an explosions without the subscription as of now

 since the use of clones and the randomness of the directions create some amazing effects

Global Variables would be pretty sweet! That would definetely be amazing

I was thinking of another idea

 having a little pull out side bar that has a list of variables so that you can view them while the project is running (you might've already seen the topic I made for that)

Lists and Layers would also be very useful.

I really want to get into Python more

 but there's something about Hopscotch that makes it special

One last idea to make Hopscotch pretty spiffy would be adding perspective to objects

 so one part of an object would be ""deeper"" than another part. Hmm ü§î

Then you can make 3D spinning text

(This would integrate the Layers idea) (Layers are so cool)"

No! I shouldn‚Äôt! I take everything as seriously as possible so at least one teenager in this country actually acts professional.

Heeey there totes my goats bro

I agree with you on that one

 but maybe taking absolutely everything seriously is a little too much

 I mean

It's awesome that you are wanting to act professional

 and you're also having a great time coding on HS and Scratch

But you don't need to tell everyone to be professional to

 we are just kiddos bumping around and exploring

 which is what childhood and teenagerness is all about

It is possible to be too serious

@JonnyGamer. Look dude. You published a cool app

 not denying it. Maze Jam. If I search for that under the App Store

 I can very easily find it. Even easier because you've said it and your pfp. If I go to the developer website section

 I can find everything about you. You're whole irl name. With that information

 and you being so public with your apps etc

 I can find virtually anything I want about you.

If a 13 yo can do this in less than 2 mins

 without even trying

 what do you think older

 more experienced  people could do with that same information? And these guys might not be as trustworthy as I am. Other members of the leader team found this too. @Jazz saw all the info I did

 maybe more.

You can get seriously hurt by this. That's why the no CoF rule exists. One slip up 

 even the mention of your app

 or bc of your PFP

 people can search it up and find everything.

Please understand"

 I can certainly tell you joined in 2016

 you call us angsty teens and then *made* a topic saying that we are down the tubes. I mean

 look at the title.

""I think the forum has officially been ruined""

 way to be positive

Hypocritical much

 honestly. I don't know what to say.

You didn't even give a way to help us out

 you just made a topic complaining about the issue.

It just makes me sad that this happens

Sorry for being up front and probably rude :<h>/

I'm thinking you can view deleted posts with this maybe"

I got a weird message"

 that's too bad hmm"

 but he's bound to be back üòÇ He did it when I posted a bug issue

 it may be a bot hmm ü§î"

"Conspiracy theory

That links the theory that all of the mods on Discourse sites are trying to sell us stickers

 deleted posts are private on the ""raw""

Boooo need to hack into the admin

I found the admin login for the site"

And the people they brainwash become mods on other sites and rope people in to the stickers

Hey @BB-Box

 @JonnyGamer and @CreationsOfaNoob :slight_smile: I see you needed a way to safely share account details and discuss your collab. You might have seen this already but t1 discussed with us about a more secure way to do this:

A more secure way of sharing collab login details 

Hey everyone

 I was talking to THT about the concern of collab accounts being hacked and people's ideas for using PMs. And we'd be okay with having a moderated PM as a safer way to share account details :smiley: So when you would like to use a shared account for a collab and want to share the details with other Hops in the collab: just let me know who's involved and I'll create a PM I'll invite the creator of the account and they can post the login details I'll invite all the other Hopscotc‚Ä¶

I know you weren't doing anything bad :smile: ‚Äî sorry that I have to close this though (please feel very free to talk to @t1_hopscotch about it elsewhere :blush:)"

"But secretly the bots are the true masters of discourse 

@xse is a bot

@awesomero**bot** is a bot

@dicobot is in on it too

 he's got some fishy quotes

@**awesome**onion is also a bot in disguise

@system is an evil AI

It's AI's sneaky way of taking over the world and causing the singularity of stickers"

"[quote=""ChickenGirl

 post:4965

 topic:32275

Yknow I‚Äôm very loosely religious. I believe there is a god

 and share a lot of Christian ideology but don‚Äôt go to church or stuff like that. The thing that hurts me is that supposedly LGBT isn‚Äôt moral in Christianity. I think that any god who wants to hate because of love or outlaw love is no god of mine. God would not have made us if he didn‚Äôt want us. Nothing God does is an accident.

I think this was a pretty good arguement right here üëç

God doesn't hate people

 or make them in a certain way in this fashion. We all have temptations

 and we all have different temptations. However if we give in to them

 it is still a sin. (And sin is the same)

God loves everyone

 and wants us to choose him and overcome our temptations. He always gives us a way out. No temptation is too powerful to overcome any person.

Now I don't agree with LGBT actions

 but I don't go off and rebuke people and say

 what you are doing is wrong and I'm right"" this is the worst way to come about something. (Proven psychologically)

I'm going to choose to show love

 even if I don't agree with choices that people make. I'm going to choose to show kindness and respect and peace and anything possible. That is what us as Christians are called to do

 show love to everyone no matter what. Now this may seem hard

 but with the power of a Christ we can do all things. We are never supposed to hate anyone

 we are supposed to love everyone. What I do hate is the sin and sadness in the world

 I despise all the evils and terrible actions

 but not the people.

In other words

 Christians are supposed to act in such a loving and sacrificial way towards everyone

 that people will see their actions and want to become like them and believe.

I really hope I didn't upset anyone and say anything offensive

 if I did please tell me. That is the last thing I want to have happened.

I also want to apologize for all of the flames tonight

 I'm really sorry"

There were like 300 flamey postos so it tops Xse right now in the weekly standings lol üòÇ Although it was ungley:<h>/

 we don't need to agree on every single detail

 and we do need to show respect for each other

 which you have done and I appreciate it thanks üòÑ

[quote=""ChickenGirl

 post:4989

I don‚Äôt view LGBT love as a sin

 but I understand you do

I don't believe LGBT love is a sin

 because I believe it is a temptation

 it's the actions that are the sin. (I'm not sure if that's what you meant to say

 I may have misunderstood you

This turns more into a religious arguement I guess (If you believe in the Bible

 Paul writes about homosexuality somewhere

 I'll try and find it if you'd like)

(I sorta was in the flame at the beginning

 but I took myself out of it since it was getting ulgey pretty quickly. It's unfortunate that this happened tonight.)"

Calculating Pi in Hopscotch

"I was thinking of using clones to make a binary calculator which would convert into base 10.

The clones would display the numbers so that high precision calculations would be possible.

Speaking of pi day

Maybe there should be an app with different formulas to calculate pi

 and you could watch the process of the formulas run as they diverge to pi."

 California weather is pretty nice

 I'm tired sort of and I'm doodling around hehe doing some things how about you"

"Yeah that's true

I like getting an extra hour hehe

They should find out a way to slowly and progressively take away the extra hour

 but idk it may be too confusing. It would be nice because otherwise people are 17% more likely to have a car crash and also much more likely to have a heart attack something or other. Idk something or other"

Oop yeah ok that makes sense

I know right! Pretty spiffy ay

"I‚Äôm trying to do something like that on JavaScript

 my dad is using this extrapolate function which makes it easier

 but I don‚Äôt know for sure. Since in JavaScript you lay down ellipses to draw.

 I‚Äôm using this app called HyperPad and it‚Äôs brilliant

 it‚Äôs similar to Hopscoth but you can actually publish apps to the App Store (but you‚Äôd need a developer‚Äôs ID I guess)"

Do you think Hopscotch more of a coding app or a Social media app?

"Hopscotch is totally a social media platform currently. The forum has definitely become a social media platform

 and nothing else (except for the rare few). 

The app itself has a worse ratio of (good projects : bad/spam projects). 

This issue has been around for years though

I like that Super Mario Mini Games has been up top for a while huzzah!

"It won‚Äôt get solved

 we need a new management system that can determine if remixed projects actually have different code. Projects with very little code

 or immediate remixes should show up in a separate category (or maybe artists should be using art apps for better drawings). Still

 most people publish projects with very little code

 most users aren‚Äôt as inspired as before

 most users have left. It‚Äôs an ongoing process

 Hopscotch has its good years

 but now it‚Äôs just riding the waves down

 and then another new app will be way better.

People like COAN have been amazing outliers

 who have pushed Hopscotch to its limits (We really need to do something special for him)"

 sometimes I really do care about the direction of Hopscotch (Like during the time when I did the State of the Forum topics in Jan and Feb) but sometimes I just give up and chat with friends and other businesses. It really is a sad situation

 mostly because of the lack of activity from the moderators. Kids like us can‚Äôt really self run a place because we just wanna be kids

 not be super serious all the time (which is the creativity part

 we can intertwine it with our coding

 for example the Soup Sim project). I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs just a butch of ranting

 that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm learning JavaScript and Swift so I can do more coding in different ways"

"Sorry for the long reply lol

We do need to do something for COAN but I don‚Äôt even know what we could do

If we could nominate him as a Hopscotch mod that would be wonderful

 except maybe that‚Äôd stress him out since it is a lot of word but I doubt THT would even do anything about it

 ever since 2016.. THT just needs to run their conpany"

"I‚Äôm going to make a topic called

 Conversations about the Direction of Hopscotch because all of this is valuable info"

Conversations on the Direction of Hopscotch

"If you‚Äôre anyone like me who has been on Hopscotch since the beginning (or at least a few years)

 you‚Äôve seen the direction that Hopscotch has been leaning into. It originally started one way

 but it has shifted over the years to something different.

Has this been a positive or negative change to Hopscotch? Maybe it‚Äôs been neutral? In the following conversation

 we will discuss our opinions of what‚Äôs really going on here.

[details=For example we will look at:]

Project Quality

Featured Projects

Remixing/Rehopping

The Forum Quality

Hopscotch Moderation

The Future of Hopscotch

Artwork in Hopscotch

Chatting/Social Media Aspects

Trending Tab

We‚Äôve gotta give credit to COAN

 he‚Äôs top notch

All conversation is top quality

 anything goes. What are your ideas?"

"Hogging this post right now

Global Edit when I become regular"

"That‚Äôs correct! Valgo‚Äôs kaleidoscopic project or whatever it was called was on the top of Game Changers for at least 2 years

 resulting in it being to most liked projects

 remixed project

 you name it

It was a great project for its time

 and really should be a tutorial for new coders"

"Me too. There should be a setting where you can change the art style of how the editor is displayed. And the community

I really liked the community layout when it first was out

 but maybe I‚Äôm just biased (How To‚Äôs were also sweet)"

"But drawings on Hopscotch are good in a sense

 it‚Äôs creativity through artistic expression. But there really needs to be an art category

 not just the trending (and trending has been broken for years)"

"I just really don‚Äôt like the aspect of trending. If a new project gets a certain amount of likes in a timeframe

 up it goes. In Hopscotch‚Äôs recent update

 it is much easier to create new profiles. That‚Äôs how I got the -1 span project thing to go crazy

 because I wanted to show THT how broken the trending actually was

If there was any way they could keep track of IP‚Äôs

 or not trust likes from users under 1 day old"

 topic:46102""]

Featured Projects: Getting less and less likes

 and quality just going down

Completely agreed

 remember that one balloon game that got featured earlier his year? I‚Äôm gonna find it

It didn‚Äôt even run properly"

 there needs to be software that can tell how much code is changed in a remix"

"@Got_This_Glow this one:

There‚Äôs no way it could‚Äôve got 1700+ likes

There‚Äôs no way..

 it‚Äôs some weird epilepstic game. It‚Äôs should‚Äôve at most been on Rising

 but in no way featured.

I thought Featured projects were supposed to be a new idea

 innovative

 good code

 and fun to play.

(Which is another reason why artwork and pixel art and trail art should have its own Featured Art category

 because some of it really is good)"

"Which leads to

 COAN‚Äôs projects should all be on featured. THT needs to bring back the auto follow

 where you would be automatically followed to a great hopscotcher (so you can actually see their projects

 especially if THT isn‚Äôt featuring them)"

I really do hope THT makes some changes"

"I wish the hopscotch team would consider our ideas

 because for the past couple years Forumers have been addressing the fact that Hopscotch is different

 but it seems like it has been a wasted effort. (And a lot of time has been spent creating new ideas

 fixing problems)

Which is why we have taken a downward shift

 it‚Äôs sort of like Hopscother‚Äôs got unencouraged to make ideas and code games. We haven‚Äôt gotten any form of recognition from the moderators since 2016.

If Hopscotchers we able to have some sort of voice

 that would be beyond amazing. It‚Äôs like giving reviews and critics on how the app runs

 from people who use Hopscotch. But I guess THT has been happy with he way things have been going (or maybe their working on a VR Hopsoctch super mode)

Maybe I‚Äôm just being selfish and over critical though and only looking at the down sides of Hopscotch. Hopscotch is a truly incredible coding material

 and probably the best start and bouncing pad for young coders

 which is probably what it should stay to be. 

(We need to make a list of projects like Game Changers

 but a complete list for the most influential projects of all time

 and projects that are also great for new coders so that they can learn)

I hope some of that made sense

Oh my Hamil!!!!!!!!!!!

Who the Hamil!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"Jeffery offers his apologies to the almighty Hamill

"Yeah that is true

It would be good to have a section for art of all types (interactive would be different) rather than no section"

JonnyGamers Official Brain Storm (false news in second post)

"# JonnyGamer‚Äôs Official Brain Storm

 you have stumbled across JonnyGamer‚Äôs Official Brain Storm! As you can tell

 I‚Äôve posted 300+ consecutive times. But why? This place is like a blog page.

What‚Äôs The Point! I‚Äôm going to edit each post and add a new idea

 challenge

 for an ultimate blog posting experience. If you like blog things and new ideas.

So yes

 welcome and have a good time!

I would prefer if you would **refrain** from posting here. I might have a link to a debriefing topic. Thanks so much!

This entire topic is Under Construction all the time. This might change later.

Have any recommendations? Would **you** like to blog a post? Well

 all you have to do is type it up

 I‚Äôll pop it in

 and viola! (In the future I might just do global edit so it‚Äôs easier. But I‚Äôm not a reg)"

"# Table of Contents

"# All About The TimeStamp!

Bam! As you may know

 COAN has discovered the getTimeStamo function!

What is it? Sooo: When computers were first invented

 there was this global code that started at 0

 and every sending it adds one. It‚Äôs like ‚Äúthis is year 2018‚Äù but for computers it‚Äôs ‚Äúthis is second 5 billion something‚Äù

So.<h>. What does that have to do with anything? COAN has edited the JSON file to get this function

 and put it in a Hopscotch Project. THIS MEANS: A project can now tell you what exact time it is (gmt time) on your device! Crazy right!

His new project that‚Äôs featured allows you to change time zones.l to your exact location (Mine is -7 GMT)

**Alright:** This is cool

 but what else can you make instead of a clock.<h>.

**IDEAS:**

- Countdown to Christmas

- A Project that Changes every day of the Week

- Yeah that‚Äôs it so far"

"# Exceedingly Difficult Hopscotch Challenge!

So I have come up with a new challenge:

Follow this link for more details:

[details=Working on this Part Currently]

# Minimalistic Hopscotch

What does this mean?

Let‚Äôs try to simplify Hopscotch down as much as possible.

This means:

Could we build games in Hopscotch using:

- 0 Variables (They are stored elsewhere)

- Minimal Amount of Rules (Hopefully 1?)

Where can we store variables though!

- Positions of Objects

- Rotation

- Invisibility

- Speed

- etc

How can clones communicate without using variables?

- That is a good question

 I‚Äôm just going to edit this post

"# Saving Strings Inside Variables

This has been a long wanted feature of Hopscotch. Variables save numbers that can be changed or used later. But what about text or objects?

If we could save text

 what could we do?

A text based adventure game!

If (input) = (‚Äúxxxx‚Äù)

Respond: (‚Äúyyyyy‚Äù)

Now we would be able to say

 if someone says this

 say this back in return. SUPER COOL!

[details=What else can we do with strings?]

**Add them:**

‚ÄúHello‚Äù + ‚Äú ‚Äú + ‚Äúthere‚Äù = ‚ÄúHello there‚Äù

**Find the N<sup>th</sup> digit**

‚ÄúHello‚Äù.0 = H

‚ÄúHello‚Äù.1 = e

‚ÄúHello‚Äù.5 = null (The 6<sup>th</sup> digit it empty)

**Uppercase/Lowercase**

allCaps(‚ÄúHello‚Äù) = ‚ÄúHELLO‚Äù

noCpas(‚ÄúHello‚Äù) = ‚Äúhello‚Äù

**Reverse/Flip**

rev(‚ÄúHello‚Äù) = ‚ÄúolleH‚Äù

**Ceasar Shift**

ceasar(‚ÄúHello‚Äù)(1) = ‚ÄúIfmmp‚Äù

ceasar(‚ÄúHello‚Äù)(-1) = ‚ÄúGdkkn‚Äù

ceasar(‚ÄúHello‚Äù)(26) = ‚ÄúHello‚Äù

**Center Text; Left Orient; Rigth Orient**

The text is currently always centered. We should have code that aligns it left and right

**Input Alert Box**

Alerts would be great

 they arr just input boxes were you can type things ib

**Etc**

There‚Äôs a lot of ideas here!

Is there any way we can code it on Hopscotch?

I‚Äôll need to ask TBS"

Made a ‚ÄúSave String‚Äù project for real

Uses Base27 conversion to Base10

Gonna be a text based adventure"

Or others

Wanna help me on a text based adventure game?

I‚Äôve created an app that converts 6 digits of letters to Numbers; and I‚Äôve also create a simple app with 3 riddles on it

Wanna do some -1 thing :<g>D

I just need some inspiration"

Save Strings In Hopscotch!

"Hello Hopscotchers!

I have just created a simple riddles app.

This App allows you to type in an input!

It actually saves text into variables!

Here you go:

[details=More About This App]

You can input any 6 digit word

 it converts it to a base-10 number

 and checks if you got an answer right.

What‚Äôs more: I didn‚Äôt use **any** variables to make this project! How about that :<g>D

Check the code to see what I used instead

This is just a beta app

 I‚Äôm hoping to make a text based adventure game

I converted base-27 to base-10 using an algorithm

Yes please! <banana banana nanna>

I should do that in an update definitely"

I used all of the pregiven variables

So my main object that finds the 6 digit word in base10 is working on a 6 dimensional hypercube"

"Base2 = 0

 100 ...

Base3 = 0

 22

Base11 = 0

 8

 A

 10 ..."

It‚Äôs magical Sauce <bananas>

Hopscotch would be able to save 14 digit sentence/ideas and turn them into numbers. Using letters

 space

 period

 question

 extra char

That‚Äôs cool"

"It has been seen

There it is

"A - Z and a space bar

 it‚Äôs 1 - P

But it‚Äôs ok if you shift it

It‚Äôs cool"

Yeah oops <hsbsnsnsnznnsnz>

 after base 10 we run out of digits to use so we just use letters

Or it can be any other symbol it doesn‚Äôt matter

 as long as you translate it right"

Some chat topic of me

I‚Äôm confused about this topic <Hanson>

"There are infinitely many bases

I think you‚Äôve got the general concept"

Oh I don‚Äôt know what happened to it actually

 and every number has a different symbol

There is no solution to 10 = x + 1 in this base

 since 10 does not exist"

Ok would be an interesting value in Base infinity

I‚Äôm trying to figure out ways to communicate between clones without variables

It might have to be through the clone index with adding and deleting clones"

Congrats I played the bear game an hour before it got featured

I was also explaining to my brother how trending is useless since it has so much art in it

 and any game that rose to the top would get featured anyway

And yours was #2 on trending and then it got featured üòÇ

It‚Äôs an awesome BTD game!"

What about total clone value?"

Then it may work

I‚Äôd have to do a bunch of cloning to save a value

 retrieve that value in the first rule

 then destroy all the clones again

So they could potentially communicate variables without using variables. Maybe"

"Yes! It‚Äôs back!

It disappeared for a while

Keep it on topic thx (Just post these little insight blurbs)

"**Game Changers Reorderd. Again**

<banana> Is it just me or did they reorganize the Game Changers list today so that Kaleidocosmos is back on top @Valgo @everyone"

"**Halloween Characters. 5 years later**

Who else got the new Hopscotch update today? They finally gave us back Halloween characters"

"Yes so **hsrd** to type on this small device

Need hslp"

"**Remember The How-To‚Äôs Category?**

They should bring it back

Whenever I‚Äôm offline and I check the tabs and see ‚ÄúFeatured

 Newest

 How-To‚Äôs‚Äù I get excited. But then I realize I‚Äôm offline."

"**I was born in Year 0000. No lies**

Whenever I copy a project link or create a new account

 Hopscotch asks me what year I was born.

This is too much persona<Hansen Shan>l info for me to give away

 so I type

 ‚Äú0000‚Äù.

Strange that it works. It doesn‚Äôt work in the ‚Äúbuy subscription‚Äù though. How odd"

"**#FeaturedChallenges Tab**

What was this tab category for again? St. Patrick‚Äôs day 2017?

You‚Äôre right Hopscotch

# It‚Äôs almost like a *Fredric<lake ksks>k*

"@Petrichor what is this new discussion category l will make a look-see

Oh wait never mind it was a tag"

"**Hopscotch Video Ad in the App Store**

 In the App Store

 Hopscotch has a little video ad you can play to see what the app is like. Near the tail end of the video

 they show some gameplay of Super Mario Mini Game‚Äôs Super Mario Adventure app.

 the gameplay that is shown for about 3 seconds actually cannot be played in the game. It‚Äôs like they edited my brother‚Äôs app and then screen recorded it. It‚Äôs super weird

Even weirder!

This video can‚Äôt be seen on an iPhone

 only on iPad App Store. Super strange they forgot to update the video ad for iPhones."

"**No More Hopscotch Classroom App**

So Hopscotch removed the $10 Hopscotch Classroom app. It looks like they‚Äôve just merged it with the main app. In the sign up you can say you are an educator and create a classroom for free. That‚Äôs rad."

Happy cake day @Nindriod7

"@Aariv I am 16

Can you delete the off topic post thanks"

Good luck on your HHC18 game!

Yeah what‚Äôs up with everything breaking lately

Hopscotch is ruined

[details=What was here before]

You can see what I mean when you play anyone‚Äôs projects (for example COAN)

All the projects are broken! How about that

It‚Äôs this weird bug that came in this new update.

Things that don‚Äôt work:

Abilities (if the first thing in the ability is a check if)

In already published projects

 some objects get deleted too! How about that!

This is so confusing and is putting a giant hurdle in the road for my HHC18 submission

ThinBuffaloSr‚Äôs text adventure doesn‚Äôt even get displayed anymore!

This is one major bug

"Yeah uh oh

The text keyboard for my -1 app doesn‚Äôt even run anymore

None of the keys show up"

"In the -1 app

 the random title screen doesn‚Äôt work either

It‚Äôs super weird I‚Äôm so confused

I‚Äôve sort of fixed it

 but I‚Äôve ended up having to place ‚Äúwait 0 milliseconds‚Äù in all sorts of places. I also got the keyboard to show back up

Flagging Posts and Topics

"# On Flagging

Let‚Äôs discuss:

When is it *really* necessary to flag a post or a topic?

Flag rule 1

Is the post/topic inappropriate in anyway: as in

 does it swear

 make fun of people

 personal info

 etc. ?

Flag rule 2

They tag omtl constantly; act disrespectful; etc

Here‚Äôs some more questions

Why do we flag posts?

What counts as spam?

If I don‚Äôt see the point in a topic should I flag it as spam?

If I don‚Äôt like a person can I flag them as inappropriate?

So many people have been flagged lately

Is there another way to respectfully approach a person instead of hurting their status on the forum??

Thank you for your time

I saw that @Petrichor got into the Jeffery account

"Willy wonka

"Yes the login is so tricky

Only non puny mortals can access it"

":<h>0

I am very sorry

I did not mean for that to happen"

Petrichor is regular I think

"Yes his friend is very imaginary

I saw your -1 key project with i"

But what is e^(i*pi)

"e = 2.71828..

i = sqrt(-1)

pi = 3.1415...

e^(i*pi) = -1"

"e is another important number like pi.

(n + 1/n)^n is a formula that approaches e

The infinite sum of 1/(n!) is also e

e is also the natural logarithm"

I saw @Petrichor hopping around a jolly good muffin

"Yeah it is a very interesting number

2.7182818459045..."

Yeah that‚Äôs just i * sqrt(pi)

Did petrichor just leave a sneaky posto

Global Clone Data

"I see what you did there

This is very smart great job

I‚Äôve always wanted to do something like this for a Game Of Life cellular automata but fast in Hopscotch. I haven‚Äôt figured out how to do it though

I wish there was an easy way to call a clone at index x"

"Yeah I saw that too

 I was like is this just me?

Notifications are very buggy oh wow"

"Oh yeah it was featured

That‚Äôs so odd"

You must be in one of the chilly states my jolly good friend

"This app is magnificent. It‚Äôs amazing how you figured it out

I was looking through the code and it‚Äôs definitely very complex. This code reminds me of the keyboard string saving code where the letters (and in this case cells) value are stored in one large number that describes what is being displayed

This is absolutely incredible"

Testing out some interactions

"Number 1 will **definetely** be very helpful.

It‚Äôs so hard to look at complex nested math blocks and see where each one is nested in

Multiple Ideas

After looking at @ThinBuffalo‚Äôs post

‚Ä¢ Check if (is touching iPad) { /code/ }

Would be extremely helpful. A lot of code simplification. Adding the purple blocks to check if statements would be **super** helpful.

‚Ä¢ New math operator:

!( /code/ )

A not block (not to be confused with factorial)

Now you can make when !(iPad touching) and when !(iPad hears a loud noise)

‚Ä¢ The ability to acces a clone of index ‚Äún‚Äù

So then you could say: set position to text1 clone(5)

‚Ä¢ Array storage

Probably the most useful of all would be arrays

With append blocks

 and remove blocks

 and math operators to extract values from arrays.

‚Ä¢ string storage

Another very useful thing that would make a lot of code simplified

‚Ä¢ Z layer

‚Ä¢ set scene (I saw this extracted from the json!!! So cool!)

‚Ä¢ round up/down to ‚Äún‚Äù digits

‚Ä¢ <= and >= check if statements

I think I‚Äôll make a topic for ideas.<h>.

Thank you so much for reading this!

You guys work so hard on Hopscotch

 you really do an amazing job"

Hopscotch Update Ideas

 and how it‚Äôll help Hopscotch

 and I‚Äôll add it in this post. Thanks!

[details=Mathematical Operators (4)]

>**Factorial Operator!**

How it'll help: Factorials are great!

[details=Movement (2)]

 you'll be able to watch it smoothly move towards that point without needing to use pesky trig functions or watch it jaggedly move in the x axis

>**Turn object towards a point**

Now you don't need to know Trigonometry to be able to do this!

[details=Looks and Sounds (10)]

How it'll help: Now you can create music with Fortissimo and other music stuff. You can make things quite or loud without the user manually changing the volume with the device

>**A Z-Axis**

How it'll help: Now we can use the Send to Front and Send to Back and change it to Set Layer (_)

>**Note Type**

Allows you to set different types of notes for music. Ex) [Play (Quarter) Note (G#)]

>**Set Pixel**

So you can pixelise an object on a grid without having to use those lag king Unicode blocks

 nor have to use a clone for each colour.]

>**Playing Multiple Notes at the Same Time**

 then we can create real harmonies without it sounding like 5 notes in ascending order real quickly.

>**Strings**

Now you can add text together! ""Hello"" + ""World"" = ""Hello World""

How it helps: Keeps track of a user's input. You can find the nth (input) Fibonacci number just by typing a number! The number is then run through the code and then outputted. Neat!

"Will add this to above:

[details=new ideas]

"Will also add this to above

[details=More New Ideas]

* conditionals with >= and <=

* fix the behavior of applying And/Or to an existing conditional 

[details=""More""]

Rules append the And/Or to the existing conditional 

![image|281x499](upload://mce9fNzmiCvIcCAni9eX5NwrUbf.jpeg) 

After tapping And

 the original rule conditional remains 

![image|281x499](upload://hM01RwJceEEPi06eOyyInY1s550.jpeg) 

But with If Then conditionals

![image|281x499](upload://py6J41EsvuOtxaht6KByifYBJHv.jpeg) 

Tapping And *erases* the existing conditional 

![image|281x499](upload://u42YNdzzTba6CWA8oB6VQ3olkTU.jpeg) 

* Add the ability to directly reference the traits of a specific clone 

* Add a **Select Case** block so we don‚Äôt have to deal with a UI that looks like this with nested conditionals

![image|281x499](upload://kiDzTF7QugHFdkoP7Uw00QRe4LU.png)

* Fix the trending algorithm so that it discounts Likes if the user hasn‚Äôt played the project (This will give parity to art & coded projects)

* Want to make an improvement almost *every* Hopscotchers will appreciate? Fix Bumps so they work right to begin with and don‚Äôt create so much lag.

"‚Ä¢ Wait until ( x = y )

‚Ä¢ Custon Rule (x

 y) { /code/ }

‚Ä¢ Check if (Custon Rule) { /code/ }

‚Ä¢ return True/False Booleans for Custom Rules"

">**Plus or Minus Operator**

>**Check if (Touching iPad) { /code/ }**

How it‚Äôll help: now

 within a rule

 you can double check if the iPad is being touched

 or whatever else there is. But if you could include them in if statements

 then that would be incredible

>**Elseif Statements**

How it‚Äôll help: Just an extended if else statement. Then you could have an else after all the checks have taken place

>**if !(x = y) { /code/ }**

How it‚Äôll help: Then you can do things like: when iPad doesn‚Äôt hear a loud noise. 

>**When (rule and rule) { /code/ }**

How it‚Äôll help: Now you can say stuff like: if touching iPad and also hearing a loud noise

>**Arrays**

Save multiple items inside of an array. Blocks that would come with the addition of arrays

‚Ä¢ Array.length

‚Ä¢ nth value of Array (Array.n)

‚Ä¢ Arrays in Arrays

‚Ä¢ Append value ‚Äún‚Äù to position ‚Äúy‚Äù

‚Ä¢ Delete position ‚Äúy‚Äù

>**Set Scene**

Now you‚Äôre objects won‚Äôt be clumped in 1 scene! Things that come with it:

‚Ä¢ Global Objects

‚Ä¢ If Scene = ‚Äún‚Äù (for global objects)

‚Ä¢ Preload Scene ‚Äún‚Äù

>**Round Up/Down to ‚Äún‚Äù digits**

Simplify your code

>**Nth digit of a variable**

Simplify extraction code (written as variable.n)

>**>= and <= statements**

Simplify your when and if statements"

"[details=Formatted all the new ideas]

>**Else If Statements**

Simplify your when and if statements

>**Wait until (statement)**

Now you can have your code wait until a specific action takes place

>**Parameters for Custom Rules**

Custom Rule (x

>**return True/False Booleans in Custom Rules**

>**check if (customRule) { /code/ }**

">**If Object = image**

Now you can check whether an object is a certain image or not (or text)"

">**Sprite Sheet**

Now you can add images to a sprite sheet

 and can organize/simplify animations

>**Animate**

Now an object can animate. Blocks that come with this:

‚Ä¢ Start Animation (Sprite Sheet)

‚Ä¢ Stop Animation of (object)

‚Ä¢ Frame Rate of Animation

‚Ä¢ Loops animation? ‚ÄúN‚Äù Times or forever? Until?"

">**Pause App**

Now you can completely pause an app!

>**When (Paused App) and (touching object) {Unpause App)**

Now you can unpause an app by tapping the pause button again

>**Pause/Unpause Object**

Pauses an objects movement in any way."

">**Save (variable/array) to database**

Now you can keep track of a persons total high score on something. Yes.

>**Number of Plays**

Keeps track of # of plays by a person

 or all people. (If self.numberOfPlays < ‚Äún‚Äù) or (If total.numberOfPlays < ‚Äún‚Äù)

>**getTime / getCurrentTime**

Gets the time at any time zone or current time zone. Also gets current day of the week

 month

 year

 day of the month

 hour

 minute

 second

 millisecond

>**Number of Likes**

Access the number of likes on this project

>**If Person Liked Project**

Check if the person has liked the project

>**Get Remix Value**

Get total remix number

 or remix by the user

>**Get Data on When A Project is played**

So now you can see if the user playing the project hasn‚Äôt played it in ‚Äún‚Äù timeframe.

>**Updates to projects**

Update a project

 so these projects on Game Changers can get even better (Also shows version history)

>**Get Project Age**

How old is this project

>**Get number of times edit/replay button have been pressed**

To see if they are editing the app

 or replaying the game

>**Compare Population Variables**

Worldwide high scores and challenges

 worldwide chatting

 online multiplayer games

 >**Get username**

Gets the username of the user"

Yes a music category would be great

>**Import Music**

Now you can import music that you‚Äôve created

>**Play Custom Sound**

Play a custom sound you have imported

>**If (Sound Playing)**

Checks if a sound if being played

>**Mute Sound on (object)**

Mutes an object from playing a sound

>**If Sound Playing = (this sound)**

Finds the precise sound(s) that are playing"

">**Award Badge**

Now you can award a badge in game to a player and it shows up in their profile. (For featured/game changer projects only) (THT checks these) (THT Can also award these)"

Ok I won‚Äôt tell <nananansnja>

<a class=mention>Jolly good muffin :muffin_emoji:"

"The Wikipedia page really looks like it‚Äôs been petrichor bamboozled 

Did he really? üòÇ"

Yeah sounds good I just texted you back and then heading home to see if I could get some more stuff to go home around the time I will need to help out with the boys tomorrow morning and then I‚Äôll be there

Yes squid spawning season is my favorite time of year

"Oh wait you‚Äôre name is there too

But I think it got edited back"

What a remarkable phrase you‚Äôve just described to me I feel like that‚Äôs almost a well adjustment to the situation

Sure sounds good <hon>

Petrichor is the time to get oworotorowo this is my day I  me right now

It‚Äôs a little hard to copy the 0 width character.

In the text box

 just type the letter ‚Äúa‚Äù or something

 then select all and copy it"

"We‚Äôve used this secret to do all sorts of things like topics with 5 letters

And funny stuff like

 if you quote this post it appears like there‚Äôs nothing in it but posting the quote exceeds the character limit"

I think one of the tags is a zero width character on that topic"

How you heard of the times me and petrichor broke the forum?

Is the copy not working?

"Heheheheheheherh

Don‚Äôt tell him that it‚Äôs you"

"Also Petrichor already posted on the Jeffery account

I knew he would figure out what I was doing"

"Yeah sounds good

It‚Äôs gonna be great"

"Do you know how to take the remix symbol off?

Or do you want to keep it on

If you keep it off it could rise to the top of trending and then you could show him and he‚Äôll get scared because he won‚Äôt see it coming

Or keep it on and he‚Äôll also get scared because he saw it in his notifs and get confused"

"Here‚Äôs a better website

"Yes sounds good

The perfect plan ‚Äã"

Fredric k sjbssb

Yes figured out how to make a project with no title

You use the second copy of the website for it to work

Because it‚Äôs a joiner and not a space hmm interesting"

"Hmm it needs to be something that neither of us would say to be extra confusing. Because first he‚Äôs gonna think it‚Äôs me

 but then he‚Äôll be like wait Jonny doesn‚Äôt talk like this"

"So creepy

Something pretrichor wouldn‚Äôt even think of"

"He‚Äôll probably try to login with a password of Jeffery

 but then when it isn‚Äôt he‚Äôll get super confused"

"Yes exactly üòÇ

This is gonna be very great

Much greatness

Petrichor needs to watch his back"

A -1 comedic show and all of the above

"Yes he won‚Äôt even see it coming

Also username mario password mario is a thing on HS. I‚Äôve been trying to hacc into accounts"

"Oh ok sure if it‚Äôs a ok

<sub> heheheh"

"Have you seen it on the HS app?

"It is time to join the river clan

*they won‚Äôt see it coming

Lol thanks

Also username null password null exists too<g>:100:

<sub> <sub> <sub> <sub> JonnyGamer had an account some time ago called JonnyGamer"

"Yes please! That‚Äôs the 1

Very comedic and all of the above

Thank you it‚Äôll be great no matter what

"Yes that‚Äôs perfect üëå 

Very well displayed exactly what he needs"

Yes it‚Äôs for Nindroid

If you make it goofy and random it‚Äôs gonna be perfect"

"Yeah I know it‚Äôs crazy

I was trying to make a faster one

 but the clones touching wasn‚Äôt working properly rats

The touching function gets super weird"

"Yes that would be a smart move

Or you could surprise them"

"Yeah it happens

Woah what‚Äôs the relationship wheel project in the drafts?

 is the Jeffery pad UHD laggy or does it work fine?"

Ah I see this gives me an idea üí°

What does the lagginess do? Does it just take a while to print the drawing?

Ah ok yeah that makes sense

"No that‚Äôs perfect

Yes definitely publish it"

"Yess he won‚Äôt even see it coming

He‚Äôs gonna do something pretty swell

I wonder if it‚Äôs possible to bring a project to the top of trending and then unlike it so it have 0 likes

"Heheheheh 

Actually I‚Äôm not gonna do it it takes too long

Should I make a Jeffery can Speake project where it‚Äôs just a random sentence generator but more complex?"

 but it‚Äôs gonna have all sorts of stuff and decorations"

"Hmm let‚Äôs see

I‚Äôm just doing random stuff

I‚Äôm working on this relationship wheel a copy of it

You should code something hmmm let‚Äôs brainstorm"

"Ok sounds good it‚Äôs gonna be so funny

I‚Äôm almost finished with this wheel I‚Äôll publish then unpublish and show you what I did"

"Heh lol that‚Äôs awesome üòÇ

Rex is definitely hopping around"

"Yeah why‚Äôs he doing that +2 is complete heresy

Here‚Äôs what I did

If you replay it the number of circles changes

Idk I might have ideas for it

Yeah sure <nensnsnanananna>

I can totally make a bunch of little random ideas if you want for future projects. I think that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll do

"I just saw the project

That‚Äôs awesome üòÇ it‚Äôs perfect"

You just went and snuck around the corner

"How come so many users have the name spoopy in them

It‚Äôs very many

There‚Äôs like more than 3"

Very spoopy"

"It‚Äôs so spoooy

I don‚Äôt even know what to do

Oh I just got an idea

I shall code it right away"

I‚Äôm gonna make a spoopy project

"It‚Äôs just a little spoopy face with a few randomized words

Very simple project

May use it for Jeffery can speake later on

Almost finished"

"If you copy a project link and paste it here

 it will expand giving the project title and the username

 then you can copy it"

Hopefully this will work

"Ok awesome no problem

Sneaky petrichor"

"That‚Äôs quite a bit of snakes

How can we ever sneak by"

"Those laser pointers have saved the day

We are in control of all the snakes"

All of the sneks and snakos and topapoes

They will never get away with our sneaky topopito laser beam

"We have now recieved all topapoes

What a wonderous day this is"

It is a warnderful spoopy @JonnyGarner day @NindroidGarnes

"Did you notice the r n instead of m‚Äôs

Much spoopy awaits

A new project spoopy"

It‚Äôs almost..

Are you coding a top secret spoopy?

Lol I just saw skitzo is already confused üòÇ

"Yeah this is so awesome

You‚Äôre project should be on trending soon"

Was it remixed yet?

Hmm I wonder how trending works

"Yeah I think so too it must be different

How did he figure it out?"

Because mine went to number 2 with less than 20 plays"

"Oh So Spoopy

<bsnsnsnsnsnananann spoopy>"

"ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ü§û ü§ûü§ûü§ûü§ûü§ûü§ûü§û ‚úåÔ∏è ‚úåÔ∏è

Sleep is a a most healthy

No sleep give you spoopy

You should sleep if you

Want to"

Bye good night üëã üõ∂ <hsnnsn>

And Jeffery also relays information to me

 he says yes to it

So does Fredric<Nana Hanson>k

And my younger brother"

I ban all the people who banned people even though they did the right things. That is obviously against the rules in the first post and the wrongdoers deserve to be banned.

"That is also true!

Spam flaggers must be banned!"

"250 Timeframes

250 Adjectives

250 Nouns

250 Verbs

Timeframe Adjective Noun Verb Adjective Noun and Adjective Noun

250^8 Combinations Yess"

Most programming languages use these tools

">**More Precise Int Variable**

Now you can store integers to many decimal digits without it turning to scientific notation"

"Thank you! Yeah that‚Äôs what I was guessing it was. 2^(28*38) That‚Äôs super large. Wow! This really is impressive code!

I need to study how you checked when a cell has # of alive neighbors. That would seem to be the hardest part

 but there must be some formula that you used to extract which cells were alive.

(It looks like this similar approach works with Coan‚Äôs minesweep game)

Then you can also save pixel art drawings (however adding color and more pixels would greatly increase the numbers being worked with.)"

Ok <msksnsnsknsmanaman>

@Petrichor is it really time

ArtisticCoder's general topic

"That‚Äôs not an idiotic statement whatsoever

It‚Äôs a natural thing for parents

 when they don‚Äôt know who you‚Äôre communicating with online without restrictions

 to protect their children

You wouldn‚Äôt want your own kid abused without you knowing

It‚Äôs kind of like driving in a car

 you must drive defensively

 thinking that everything is out to get you

 so that you are safe. You must have total concentration and observation

 same goes with the internet"

"I believe that this may in fact

be the time"

"The mindset of

 I‚Äôm going to set boundaries for my kid so that they don‚Äôt have total access to the internet (but they can have some) so that they don‚Äôt get abused

 distracted by social media

 distracted by politics

 addicted to video games

 becoming sleep deprived

 etc. And instead to have their kid flourish and follow their passions and make a difference in the world.

Having complete access to the internet isn‚Äôt a right

 and it‚Äôs most definitely not healthy for you"

I apear to have returned

Yes much @Avocado <NB>

"@SarcasticTvHead where art though went to

@Petrichor I found all of the Hopscotch assets online"

"Yeah it‚Äôs really fascinating (I am most definitely not trying to find a list of passwords)

I saw near the end a list of all of the characters that you can use in Hopscotch and their link extension to open the file but I don‚Äôt know how to open them

There were drawn in vector it seems .svg"

"Oh wow that‚Äôs pretty epic!

I was hoping there were characters that weren‚Äôt used in the app"

The person or just anyone in general?

The coders also added commented links to all sorts of websites and I haven‚Äôt checked them out yet. Mostly videos

"Toy? <banana banana>

Much prank"

"I‚Äôll copy and paste a few

I found them using command f finder tool

Here is most of them (a lot of others at w3 and other coding material)

I‚Äôm trying to find the assets of the users and passwords. They are hidden on a web server somewhere

I found the .svg for the characters but I don‚Äôt know how to open them"

Do you have any ideas to do random stuff?

I found that you can login to an account on the website (it just says: ‚Äúhello /user name here/ ‚Äú when you login) However

 you need to use your email as the username. Brute force seems to be allowed so I might right some code to do that."

How do you do it?"

I must apologize to Nindroid <a class=mention>I‚Äôm so sorry"

<a class=mention> yes please nindroid I even did a mention

Is there a password that allows you to access all student accounts?

"Is that a classroom?

Wow how did you do it?? That‚Äôs super impressive"

1000 <jsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnnan>

"Wow that‚Äôs crazy!

Nexxt step: find passwords for all users

Nexxt step: rename all users to null

Nexxt step: disallow users from changing their names

Nexxt step: Post a project on all accounts saying: I follow the immortal"

"Best shows in the whole wide world

Tuck in"

"Next step: corrupt all Hopscotch servers

Next step: Put Hopscotch out of business

Next step: Recode Hopscotch and get it featured to new App Store"

Did they just go and steal my character

"Oh wow that‚Äôs incredible

I wonder how many classrooms have been made and are active?"

Mine is 132 weeks ago

I‚Äôve also got it copywrited and I‚Äôm writing an app for the App Store currently gonna publish it super soon"

Hmmm... (conspiracy MagmaPOP‚Äôs account was made in a classroom)))))))) it all adds up now"

Those are really tight princes

They must have copied me oh well it happens

The hotdog one? ayesham11

"Wow it was made November 2018

Wait a second"

"Yess

Ban the admins"

Number 1 goal: find the admin login

Also this new classroom that was created must have been made in NewYork or further since its November

I‚Äôm gonna create a new account and see if it goes to November since here in ca it‚Äôs still October 31"

Is this Halloween costumes??

"@Mr.rex I remember that too

"I‚Äôm so scared

That‚Äôs actually pretty good artwork

Spooked me"

"Woah what‚Äôs the roster?

How did you figure this all out? Just from the assets?

I found the links where they store a couple of graphics but it‚Äôs covered up by white stuff. It loads

 but it‚Äôs only white and invisible. I‚Äôve tried to inspect and reveal but it didn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôll send you a link"

"Much edgy

Much Halloween

I created edgy Halloween trail art"

Very much edgy"

"Oh wow that‚Äôs super insane

I wonder if there‚Äôs a similar method to finding regular accounts. I talked to xse for a little and he said it might not be possible. But this makes me think it could be

They are accessing the accounts list through socket.io but the info might be stored on their database"

"How did you figure it out

We are conversing on how to take over Hopscotch"

"Yeah I wish THT didn‚Äôt remove the invite button

We could do it on wbf or meta.discourse"

"No I‚Äôll do some research right now

If we can find the emails

 then we can write code to do a brute force on the logins"

Invite on a secret room

Tv wants to join the secret chat about taking over the forum wanna go to meta.discourse ?

*thanks for the invite*

"It‚Äôs giving me a worming to double check the link

 but it also shows the password reset button

I want to reset user hello@gethopscotch.com"

Yes it‚Äôs here the hopscotch series yes thank you so much -1 will be pleased

Have you logged in through the website yet? It‚Äôs so weird it just says

Jeffery is bouncing around in Jeffery land today"

Jeffery just made a cake for class tomorrow

So I found that little 4 digit number code in the link you can adjust and find more classrooms. You probably knew that already"

So the latest is 8379 then ok that makes sense

"Yes much sugary sounds good and dandy

Wow it‚Äôs so crazy THT stores these all so insecurely wow

"Yeah I was just testing that right now

I tried 0000 and 0001 and 1 and 1000 and those didn‚Äôt work

8000 worked I‚Äôll try 4000"

Oh wow you‚Äôre right that‚Äôs interesting

"Notice the older classrooms don‚Äôt have the 4 digit accounts

Yeah the 4001 group is Jan 2018"

"Yeah definitely

Hmm maybe it‚Äôs some different link then I wonder what"

"No I don‚Äôt

What are they?"

"THT is ID 16???? Wow!

I‚Äôll look up the SQLite in the assets"

Let‚Äôs see"

Who‚Äôs on the wb right now?

I‚Äôll make a name list on the white board

You hacked like 100

"That‚Äôs gonna be it for sure!

When do you want to tell her?"

"Do what to us? <banananna>

I‚Äôm just drawing socks"

Banned from where?

Ok sounds good üëå

Are they all still on?

Did she post something?

Oh nothing I was just wondering

What did you want me to screen shot?"

It‚Äôll be extra spooky"

Do you think we took it too far?

I gave away your location to wikileaks for some worldwide leakage

"Oh ok thanks

Yeah I remember that now"

"Yeah I couldn‚Äôt believe you figured it out

It was perfect timing too"

I didn‚Äôt know you were banned

Wait there‚Äôs a story mode :<h>0o0

"What happened today? There was a lot of posting?

I think we really took it too far yesterday :<g>/

My apologies"

Yes <banana banana an it is what we do>

Possibly offensive idea

So I made a topic like this recently and it got flagged

Hey me too <jnansnsnsjs>

Sneaking 100 times on the computer

"Yeah I‚Äôm reading it <bsnsnsnsn>

"Oh I‚Äôm so confused

Can someone give me an arm up please <sub> please I feel like something terrible happened and I don‚Äôt know what happened"

"Come again

<sub> 111 is probably nindroid"

"Was his info leaked somehow?

How did this encoding message work?

Woah this is high level stuff"

"Nindroid didn‚Äôt leave

He created @111 and is spying on us

I know 100% for certain because of secret knowledge"

"Dude Tv thinks you left *again*

Everyone thinks you‚Äôve left

They are all so gullible those mortals

Nice touch with the liked projects message"

How did he post his private info on there?

"I know for a fact nindroid didn‚Äôt leave

But it‚Äôs a secret so I won‚Äôt tell you"

"Ah yeah that makes sense

It showed his IP and where he lives

I already know where he lives

Plus Nindroid uses a vpn so it doesn‚Äôt show an IP anyway. Just like me"

"THT banned me from this account so that any IP that comes here it won‚Äôt let me in

But with a vpn I have 0 IP and now I‚Äôm in

They did this because I have 300 accounts and it‚Äôs too hard to suspend them all so they just outlawed my IP"

"He‚Äôs just pranking everyone

Mortals are so gullible"

We did it with forum nuking back in January

I did it when I broke the forum layout for everyone in March

I can still do it jekaksndnnab

I can still do it kamalalslama"

Nindroid has that kind of sick sense of humor

"Was there an HS update?

Or do you mean the discourse"

They can‚Äôt really do anything about the forum

Nindy and I did all sorts of stuff this year with discourse

"That one time I wrecced the forum

Nindy and I discovered that the same time that if you used a bunch of <\big> you could make this super long post and break topics so that they‚Äôd be closed

"What‚Äôs the country game

What if Nindy got into TVs account and is creating all this controversy and tv knows too and is playing along

I bet"

Haha they‚Äôll never know all of the countries

Sounds good üëå very swell very strategic

"Order of turns

"Vatican City

But then what if it isn‚Äôt a prancc

"Revenge plan:

Unpublish all their projects just like Funky63 did way back when"

What if we don‚Äôt do something like that and instead just make a bunch of forum alts that have 3 digit numbers and post on them

@JonnyGamers300thAcc don‚Äôt leave me

"Haven‚Äôt you seen Petty‚Äôs latest liked post

It just says cool

He did it 2 hours ago lol"

"Our possibilities:

1. Nindroid did leave

2. Nindroid is doing what he always does and is pranking

3. Nindroid and STV are pranking us. I mean

 STV left half an hour before I usually get on at 10

 she knows that

4. Nindroid is pranking and made new account @111"

Yeah that one was a bit much I agree

"gtgbaisoaijcryp yes indeed

<got to go but actually im staying on and instead just creepily readying your posts>"

Yes you‚Äôre all just pranking is I knew it

Hehe that‚Äôs be kind of funny but then what if it‚Äôs all true

"Oh no i didn‚Äôt even see it coming

Oh rato"

"South Sudan

Oh I thought I responded whoops my bad"

Dude everything is a prank here

United Arab Emirates

"Yeah sounds like the plan

I need to find a dime first"

Wait a second <hannssjskajajaj>

"Wait did tv say she leave too?

Or did she just say bye as I‚Äôm gtg"

"You know they both probably are saying

‚Äúyeah let‚Äôs not post for 24 hours and see what these guys do‚Äù

Let‚Äôs just act totally calm like nothing even happened as a prank"

Yes we should do that definitely

Did you do that? <Jenness>

"Dude it is real

What you talking about"

"You haven‚Äôt heard the element 120

unicosium?"

"Oh if that‚Äôs TV then it is just a prank

Called it

#PettyWhyWasntIInOnThisYouKnowIdKnowYouPetty"

"Yeah which person do you think does that most likely hmmm ü§î

No it‚Äôs not me"

"I bet you 100 vBucks it was TV

They are prancing us I knew it"

@SarcasticTvHead poke nudge nudge

"I think it‚Äôs option 2

Nindroid is pranking us"

TV doesn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs a prank

Nindy is just prancing yet again

How sluethy of him"

"But then why is @SarcasticTvHead not coming on here

Mexico <banana banana bananas>

"Nindroid is just a pranker 

That‚Äôs why"

What why did she do that

What <janajajjajajsjsbsbchcbsb>

"This is all just a ploy to get this topic some more postos

I‚Äôm Tv and Nindroid"

"You just got

Some more

@anon52517721 come and report these people"

Everyone is tagged"

"Somebody just edited Petrichor‚Äôs liked projects

The latest thing he liked was a project that titled ‚Äúcool‚Äù and now it‚Äôs gone"

Like us being ultra insensitive

"No that‚Äôs not it

We just did the wrong thing at the wrong time"

I figured she‚Äôs on

She‚Äôs super super upset

What can we do? I‚Äôm making a project"

"Yeah it was a prank

Jeffery is sorry too"

"Yeah it turns out most things are pranks with Nindy. I want to apologize for our insensitiveness

 we really went way too far"

"Yeah I‚Äôm really sorry about that as well

Is there anything that we could do for you?"

So that‚Äôs what the challenge is :<really>o

Why is there a secret message in there

It must have been Someone then

That‚Äôs funny

What a funny fish üê†"

Everyone loved him though only because he was so famous.

"Hmm that is a good question

Uhh

How about

Welcome to the Petrichor Worshipping Club or something hmmm idk"

How about something completely random

Or like

 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Squat‚Äù hmm"

 some interactive text that bounces around 

I‚Äôll whip something

And then I‚Äôll add a secret sketch tool"

Sine and cosine are quite fun mucho gundo

I could give you some teachings on the sine and cosine

"Yeah no problem

I‚Äôll make a smol project for it too :<iDisk>D

Yeah I can type up a few things

 I‚Äôll do it right now"

"sin(x) outputs numbers from 0 - 1

sin(0) = 0

sin(90) = 1

sin(180) = 0

sin(270) = -1

sin(360) = 0 = sin(0)

And it repeats

 by just adding 90.

What about the numbers in between 0 and 90?

If you do a plot of the numbers from sin(0) to sin(90) it creates a nice smooth transition from 0 to 1.

 I could right some code that says

Repeat 90 Times {

Set Position to: x (width * (sin(var) ); y 100

Increase var by 1 }

In this code

 when var = 0: width*0 = 0. So our object starts at the position (0

 1000)

As the code runs

 out object moves forward

 then speeds up

 and slows down until it reaches sin(90). sin(90) = 1

 and width*1 = width. So after the code runs

 out object ends up at (width

 100)

I‚Äôll do a project so you can see the code running

Instead of repeat 90

 you could put

 when 7 = 7. This code would run forever. Our object would start at 0

 and go up to (width

 100). After this is would start traveling backwards back to 0

100. But then it would pass the starting position and end up at (-width

100) off the screen.

After this

 it would come back to (0

100) and repeat the process"

"Good stuff üëç

I‚Äôll publish something in a moment too"

"Ok here you go

"Here‚Äôs another one where the text is going back and forth

 expirimentation is the easiest way to learn sine and cosine"

Change/Add new blocks?

"You can do this with nested ability blocks (the rainbow ones) like this:

Ability Block A {

If x = this {

 ‚Äî Then do this

} else {

 ‚Äî Ability Block A

}"

Yeah no problem! <bansnsnann>

"Yeah that is true it would be super helpful if they did

I have a topic for block ideas I‚Äôll post a link"

"I have a few posts in there with some random ideas

I hear Hopscotch might be adding delete clones

 parameters

 scenes

 and more. We shall see :<h>D

It really is too bad they haven‚Äôt updated their blocks ever since 2016"

 good night

 I saw your sin cosine tests they are really great stuffo!

We are gonna give Nindy a big spook"

But it‚Äôs sort of like the images I guess

It costs a lot of money for Hopscotch to have people monitor these things"

"Yeah hello! I‚Äôm doing good!

Sorry I‚Äôve got to go again :<h>/

Will be back on 10.00 Pm pct

It‚Äôs so great to see you!!"

Yes <janansnsjsksjskskks>

Do you want to create some evil dastardly plans?

"Hmmhmhmmhmh hhhmmm

This is super laggy owow"

"Do we want to to be a prank?

Prank someone

 or prank everyone?

The latter might cause flags ratos"

"That is one good question

He reallly knows the ins and out of the forum

I had an idea a while ago and it would prank everyone:

On April fools day

 I was gonna release designs to a Hopscotch 4.0 update (fake) under the Lisa account. These designs would be playable online through the Marvel POP app

I was working on it

 but it seemed to big of a project (there is no way I am goi g to do an editor)

However with Hyperpad I might be able to do better hmmm"

We should do something like..

Once Petrichor gets the hack to make your avatar be the same as THT

 we could remix all of THT‚Äôs projects and delete the remix symbol

 and then like them a whole bunch

"We could do that to Petrichor

Copy all of his projects"

"Yes that would be cool to do

I can‚Äôt do it since I‚Äôm on mobile

(You could screen shot the ‚Äúbugs‚Äù and create a topic)"

Uh oh I might need to slep soon :<h>/(/):);(/(

I guess so that makes sense Since you already did today

"Yeah I need to do some sleeping 

See you tomorrow Shan bo diggity evil plans"

"Sure I‚Äôll be in! <bananas>

@GalaxyCoding

"Here‚Äôs what I have so far

Press on the screen to move in the direction

I must know when the next one starts

Yes that was my goal I‚Äôm glad it is working @anon95978765

I‚Äôm noticing a lot of people are angry at Nindy

"He doesn‚Äôt ignore people

He‚Äôs just a super busy person"

At least I don‚Äôt think

"He uses a laptop

Things like that happen with a laptop even when your not on"

"Yeah you probably should

He uses a laptop to hack hopscotch with more quality"

"A bunch of us accused COAN of being a hacker to a collab account solely on the reason that his last seen was always just now.

In the morning he did reply and he was so confused (and the hacker turned out not to be him) but it was sort of embarrassing and we joke about it

We tagged him like 20 times lol whoops"

"Yeah laptops are much better I agree

Then you can spam like people at 200+ likes per minute"

Thhank for the new Nindy juice much necessary jeejnndndndndn it‚Äôs mega time

Secret spam liking techniques on laptop

Will show in moment"

"Why is everyone so upset at you

Those foolish mortals"

"While reading posts you can press the ‚ÄúL‚Äù key to like a post

There‚Äôs another key that you press

 I forget which letter

 that lets you read the next post

You just tap these two buttons back and forth as fast as you can (and you can target one person if you wish by clicking their avatar

 and then when it says ‚Äún posts in this topic‚Äù on their user card

 click that

 and you can see all their posts in a specific topic"

No idea they must be hiding from -1

"Make sure there aren‚Äôt rocks ahead

If there are well all be dead

Quit rhyming I mean it

Anybody want a peanut?"

"Not that I know of

You can read a lot of posts super quick by holding down the read next post key so you can easily read 20k posts"

"Sorry I don‚Äôt have any supplies that meet your request

We only have eggy gelatin chocolates on hand"

"Yeah definetely then you can spamm everyone

With my 300 accounts I could theoretically give someone 48

000 notifications 

But I cannot use my laptop for HS ratos"

"He already ate all of them due to the inexplicable reason that they were so good

Now we only have eggo gelatin chocolate"

"Oh wow that‚Äôs actually pretty good

Adobe makes some really epic apps"

"If he does he is not willing to sharr his chocolates

Unless he wants to"

"When is the project due?

That will determine how explorative I will make my project"

"You make videos???? What! That‚Äôs wicked cool!

000 is a lot of views wow!"

"Ah ok sounds good

You should make a list of the competitors on the first post"

What kind of videos do you make?"

"You should join the space competition by GalaxyCoding

We need more people to enter

We‚Äôve got Me and Petrichor and MyPizza and Aariv and William04Gamer and a few others maybe"

How did CoaN make that clock project? (Answered)

"Oh wow this is really cool

"Hey that‚Äôs pretty cool

"Disbelief Papyrus Super Mario Maker

"No he‚Äôs @SuperMarioMiniGames

"How did you know I was @Squat

That was supposed to be secreto ü§≠ You went and figured me out again!"

"I just despise playing this game with my brother because he‚Äôs just too good at it

"Oh yeah I saw that I was mucho happy

(One time THT put up a stolen project on the home page :<h>o )

I think for their ad on the App Store they also have like 3 seconds of gameplay from Super Mario Adventure"

"Ooh which one was it?

Super de duper hopscotch"

"Ooh yes very good

I have 5 points on it I am saving up to buy something

The fishies are very evasive they always dodge! I‚Äôm gonna need to up my strategy"

"I have not only the regular ones

And the spiky ones"

Ooh I caught a big orange one!

It gave me an error sound"

With these three tips you can become so dark"

"Oh hello fellow homeschooler

Yeah I think I‚Äôm sick but staying up has made me sick ratos oh well"

It is a really good song <Nana an>

Super ovens are very neat allso

Hmm we will have to see

"<you will have to wait and seee>

<I have a super idea>

<and it‚Äôs gonna be very cool idea>

<but it‚Äôs top secret don‚Äôt tell>"

"It is so top secret you won‚Äôt even know it

It‚Äôll be splendid"

I just thought of the greatest forum prankk

"Ahahahha eheheh you will never kknow

2019 will be the end

-1 is here to rule the universe"

"Hmm maybe I‚Äôll think about it hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmh

-1 is here beware the one is rising

Epic forum prank"

"Oh that‚Äôs a good idea

I was going to create a new game for HHC18 but I gave up so I‚Äôll finish it later

It‚Äôs this epic project game that has you traveling around Hopscotch editing projects and playing other projects. It‚Äôs this super inter linking mystery"

"Yeah now that would be the ultimate prank

Nindroid and I created like 100 topics in an hour all saying it‚Äôs here and then our IP‚Äôs were banned and still are

So we‚Äôd have to do some super huge prank we should totally do it

@Squat"

@Petrichor aren‚Äôt you proud of me @Petrichor you wouldn‚Äôt believe it I took a 7 hour nap today because why not @Petrichor think I can pull 3 all nighters in a row I‚Äôm 2/3 of the way there

"You need a VPN to hide your IP

I use the X VPN app it is free"

Uhh what I do is redownlaod it every night and then delete it in the morning

"Yeah idk hmm

You also need to have a secret Apple ID because if you use a regular one and people check your purchased apps they‚Äôll see it"

"However THT might just regullar ban us like they did to @Mr.L (thankfully they didn‚Äôt do it to me just an alt)

So then we‚Äôd all need to cram onto @Squat"

Haha haha @omtl ahahahah @OMTL they‚Äôll never knowe

Ahahaha I know your last seen even though your under data is hidden

These fires really are so nasty can‚Äôt seen 50 feet ahead of me so gross

"Yeah I‚Äôm in the Bay Area but I‚Äôm homeschool so school is not cancelled

Snow days are much better I love snow days"

Aw rats I slept today

All it is is just math I‚Äôll look at the code some code

"Oh wow that‚Äôs really awesome

 skiing is a lot of fun. I used to live in Minnesota where there was snow and rain (why is there no rain here). But skiing in California is way cooler with the mountains"

"Yes the winters could get to -40¬∞ which seems kind of crazy

 now that I live here 40¬∞ seems cold. It is very tropical here

 except that there‚Äôs been barely any rain for quite a while. 

I also heard that state parks haven‚Äôt been clearing the underbrush in the forests for that past 8-10 years which is why when a fire starts it just explodes out super rapidly"

"He knows that the average FPS at the beginning is 30 FPS (or maybe he finds the average at the beginning idk I see a trigger at the beginning)

And he‚Äôs constantly updating the current FPS.

He found out that when you do certain things with the app

 the frame rate drops a certain percentage. So he‚Äôs just checking if the current frame rate is equal to a certain percentage of the starting frame rate"

"Which is how he can also find if you‚Äôve restarted a project

 it drops the frame rate by a certain percentage"

"He uses the math blocks to compare the current fps to a certain percentage of the starting fps

And bundling up the math blocks like this has the whole math expression run in one frame I think"

We should all join the @Squat account"

"Yes we need something super edgy 

What do you think"

"I just figured out how to find the popularity of each Hopscotcher

MagmaPOP is more popular than THT"

Yes that is perfecto

Yes code names are perfecto we should definitely

I‚Äôm gonna go ahead and do all of the two letter name searches 40^2 searches I think

"For AA

 the leader is Cuuuupckaaaake

But cupcake is #23 for CU"

"AA Cuuuupcaaaake

AB Jelimillabyte

AC KodeKube (This is interesting

 his name previously was Packerfan_Studios which does have an AC in it

 this is a bug) (Which must be also why I can‚Äôt find SarcasticTvHead in the search)"

"InvertedSphere

(I wonder what an actual inside out sphere is)"

Not if you use a vpn I think

Oh ok idk how to do it on laptop

"I‚Äôm InSphere 

I‚Äôm a hamster in a hamster ball sphere yes"

"Oh ok hmmm

How did you guys figure it out it is a mystery"

Yes sounds goodo goodo

Yes account trading is best they‚Äôll never know

"@Petrichor I found a bug with the Hopscotch user name search

 it saves peoples‚Äô original sign up name as their account name. If you do a search for Packerfan_Studios

 it‚Äôll show KodeKube

But doing a search for KodeKube gives nothing"

I do that on the regular

Yeah that‚Äôs what THT did to me

I could deduce that 000HVH0068685780000000H‚Äòs old username was SamuraiPizzaCat

"Idk they just can

incognito doesn‚Äôt hide IP

 it just hides your cache

Vpn‚Äôs can hide you‚Äôre IP"

And how Petrichor‚Äôs Trails used to be Nindroid Games

Just the IP I think idk"

To figure out my password or something else

That would be funny if Petrichor came on too

You are right that would be Verry funny @Petrichor

Fairly fairly funny you see!

Oh jolly muffin my head hurts

It would never have been happened before in hisorty"

Ooh now who could this be jolly good muffin

Leaders Q and A Topic

Wow great topic! Nice work!

"Can leaders make announcement topics?

Or uncategorized topics?"

Can you make a topic without any categories?

Can you approve new accounts? Or promote / demote people‚Äôs user Status?

 that‚Äôs the uncategorized topic set very cool"

Can you make custom tag groups?

"Ah ok thx

I‚Äôm gonna create a list of questions so I don‚Äôt use up postos"

Mods and Leaders are different

That makes sense cool"

Can Leaders ban users? Or check their IP <mkssmk misdmids> Adre<mcdmi inclined>ss?

"I see

Did the old community leaders ever ban users? I think they did have that ability I don‚Äôt remember so much now though"

Can you edit your own user<micmidc jisdimdeji>name?

"So I tried this sentence 3 times

Saying:

‚ÄúCan you edit your own user<misdimds midwife>ame‚Äù

Causes the akismet to put the post in a mod approval waiting list"

"Can you edit you own user trust Level?

Wait that doesn‚Äôt make sense"

Do leaders have a flag limit?

"Do they have an edit limit?

 I don‚Äôt like the edit limits"

Can you undelete a deleted post?

"Do TL4s have an edit limit?

Can they undelete a user‚Äôs deleted posto?"

Do they have a limit to how many title tags they can create?

 topic:50389

Do they have an edit limit?

I don‚Äôt like the edit limits

 post:104

I‚Äôm not sure. Possibly.

<midsidsijdsijsdijds ijdfijdfijdsi>"

"If you are a regular

 I think you can only make 3 or 5 new ones per day"

"Topic title tags

Or at least thats what has happened to me when I used to do the huge topic tag things and disturbed the forum Layout"

"Maybe it was 7? I don‚Äôt remember anymore

Or maybe @system was against me all along"

"Can they open a topic that has hit its post limit?

drawing topic 1"

Can you edit your own username?

Remember when average likes per feature was in the 2000‚Äôs

"@TrustLevel4

I remember something like this you can do

Ask @Petrichor I‚Äôm sure he remembers"

"<a class=mention>@trust_level_4</a>

Test test test hmmm"

Wow congrats! That‚Äôs awesome!

I want to make a hopscotch quadtree"

It would make collision detection super fast

"Dust simulator 2020

I want to learn how Coan did it

With quadtree magic I bet"

"No one has used the word quadtree in forum history

This is a historical momentous occasion"

"It probably was because it isn‚Äôt Hopscotch Coding related

But idk it does look really cool though"

"You would be correct

 another momentous occasion

Wow this is incredible something unforeseen"

What‚Äôs the smallest thing that hasn‚Äôt been said

 I‚Äôm the only one who has said

 ‚Äú1ks‚Äù

And I remember why too

hooray!"

"Oeokeokeokeokeoke

Oke me too"

"Or like the drawing topic too

I think the one you made should count as Hopscotch related since it was a game development topic for a game you are creating in Hopscotch"

I think there may be apple forums for c

 c#

 and swift development.

In my oppinion I think we should be able to discuss higher forms of programming on here

 since we shouldn‚Äôt stick with Hopscotch forever

 we need to expand

I‚Äôm sure Ana has a good reason

 but maybe something like this would be good for a General Topic

Part 1

Believed to be the start of all time

There is a person who once existed. He created -1. And -1 was the world. -1 is the world. -1 is all. Soon afterwards

 these two

 Petrichor and -1

 grew bored of there being only two people. So -1 created something. Something small. Something puny. He created mortals. These mortals lacked the omnipotence of their creator

 and of their creator‚Äôs creator. -1 provided for them all they needed. Even a computer. However

 this computer had small memory. The first Apple computer had just one byte. Then everything crashed. Soon

 the creators slept for many thousands of years."

ohh <msnsnsmsjs>

It‚Äôs called Maze Jam but shh it is verr secret

"Wow on the dot

Hooray"

"29.99 which is why I‚Äôm going to publish free one soon

I priced it like that because each level is hand drawn and artwork

You can visit my website if you want I may have more info there"

"Actually you can price an app 399

You can do 9999 I think I‚Äôll have to double check"

But do I have a website

ban me <msmssj>

I will notify when the free one is out it will be called Ever Maze

Swift is verry nice I leik it

Much easier than hopscotch actually way less confusing"

"Yes Swift in Xcode

Never do Swift Playgrounds though. I do not recommend playgrounds"

"Technically @Liza is oldest

But who is oldest and still active hmmm"

"No playgrounds is Swift

 just really constricted and laggy and you can‚Äôt do anything like put images in your app or create new files for separate classes it‚Äôs really annoying"

verry true then Discourse was made in 2013

"boo

Scary! !"

Dare <kdjdjdjdjdjdjd>

"Swift definitely

Then you can publish to the App Store

And it‚Äôs less confusing than hopscotch and other block based coding languages"

"But haven‚Äôt gotten @JonnyGamers300thAcc

Nnever"

"Swift playgrounds is difficult though it is verry not nice

Xcode is verry nice but you can only do it on a Mac"

I haven‚Äôt mastered swift so I don‚Äôt know

It depends what you are doing Sprite Kit is really friendly and great for 2d games while Scene Kit is not as friendly but you can do 3d

"I think objective c is way harder but I haven‚Äôt tried it yet

And ARKit is definitely not friendly at all

But it lets you do AR"

"dictionary as in

Let dict: [:] = [

"Cd is very friendly 

The rm stands for remove

the -r is recurring so it searches all directories

"I am doing research on a news project

 what you currently see is research for a project about html ideas and the forum (and a stump me article creating challenges on the forum and hopscotch app)

You could‚Äôve asked me what this was about instead of giving a warning and claiming it‚Äôs under cover chat

 to me that is hurtful. I am very serious about this I wouldn‚Äôt consider it goofing off. and since you call it news stuff

 it sounds as though don‚Äôt really appreciate it anyway

If you had actually read what we were doing

 everything discussed here is related to the reason why I created the topic in the first place. Before you presume something or make a decision

 please look into it. These things could actually be considered important to people. If you don‚Äôt agree or aren‚Äôt interested in what we do

 you don‚Äôt have to participate

If you would like a more detailed explanation

 you can ask me

<summary><a class=mention> A little something </a></summary>

I‚Äôm wondering if the name of the General Discussion Topic could be considered misleading to users on the forum. How hard could it be to be off-topic on a topic for General Discussion?

The rules of the topic are:

> **Discuss anything** and **everything Hopscotch

 forum and code-related** that isn‚Äôt covered by other categories. Collaborate on ideas and meet new friends through coding together.

That is pretty vague. It looks as though we can discuss anything? Also we can discuss everything related to Hopscotch

 forum

 or code (like

 everything?).

A more detailed explanation and definition would be extremely helpful for users so that they know whether or not they are actually on topic (And so that we can prevent closings

 incorrect applications of spam

 mass flagging

 confusion

 hypocrisy

 and blaming)."

 that makes sense. I agree with you. But as long as I am conversing in something Hopscotch related (for example -1 has many projects on Hopscotch

 including a featured one)

 it is not considered off topic.

Or if I am exploring html with the forum and discussing it

 it is considered code and forum related.

I think what also needs to be addressed is how people should go about ‚Äúgbotting‚Äù. If someone feels that a user is being off topic

 they should ask them politely first about their conversation and the related-ness it is to the guidelines. They shouldn‚Äôt just go **GBOT** and initiate an argument <sub> <sup> leading to a closed topic"

What Makes a Topic Code-Related?

"Hello @Ana

 Hopscotch App

I respectfully request to ask why topics like the following stay open

 as they aren‚Äôt code related either. Also If possible

 is there any way that you could reconsider your decision

 and reopen the Hopscotch News Crew"

"But it isn‚Äôt code-related

The Hopscotch News Crew would have reported bugs had it the chance to stay open"

 me neither

You‚Äôre Topic is a great topic

 it deserves to stay open

My question to Ana was why it got closed solely on the basis of not being code-related (When the topic was a discussion on Hopscotch News)"

"Whereas the drawing on paper topic is considerably less code-related than the a topic about creating newsletters discussion everything about the Forum and Hopscotch app. Unless I am mistaken (Which I probably am)

It would be nice if we had clearer guidelines on what makes a topic appropriate ( I‚Äôm being completely hypocritical though

 I wish General Topics could be brought back)"

Thank you! That makes a lot more sense to me.

"In what way wasn‚Äôt it code related?

Some on the conversation was about html and the forum

 probably as code-related as you can get

If something feels as though it could be off topic

 people could ask us what and how it is related to the topic instead of watching it and then claiming it isn‚Äôt. What I don‚Äôt understand is that people take the liberty to determine what they think is off topic and post gbot which initiates argument (when not done in the proper way) instead of pursuing the conversation and finding out if it is just spam

 or maybe just ignoring it instead of feeling like they need to fix it"

"No I think you‚Äôre right that was off topic. That‚Äôs fair

However at the very end of the topic I was doing this:

"And also I learned something very interesting

 if I wanted to edit a topic to reserve the drawing topic 21

 it didn‚Äôt allow me because it was too long

I‚Äôm wondering if this could cause potential disaster

 if someone edits the current drawing topic title

 there‚Äôs no way to change it back. It only allows a long title during topic creation"

"I guess we would have to determine if something is code-related does it matter whether or not it is useful

 semi-useful

 not useful

 useful only to some users

"I have looked it over

 and during these quotes

 there was also real conversation

 you are only quoting things that seem off topic

 when taken out of context. (Which of course

 it looks like chat from an outsider looking in)

During that time in which you quoted

 we were discussing a random forum pin that had occurred from 2 years ago that suddenly appeared.

We were also discussing the detriments to allowing Unicode in user names

We were also creating stump me‚Äôs (they are puzzles) for the May 2019 post (which took the majority of the time so far)"

"Ana shut down my topic for being not code-related. I am asking for more clarification on how topics can be appropriate so that my topics are not closed in the future

I did not mean to be offensive

 I apologize if I was"

"To me

 the whole topic was on topic. It depends on someone‚Äôs perspective. Should there be a defined correct perspective? To Ana‚Äôs perspective

 it seems not code related. I am asking for more clarification"

"No kidding ü§£

How did you do it"

Oke <kwkakskakks>

"Hello I failed at making a news crew

apparently"

Ana closed it for not being code-related but I‚Äôm gonna email some more explanations

I‚Äôm too lazy rn to explain the ways of Petrichor and -1"

 but on the bright side:

[poll type=number results=always min=1 max=20 step=1]

No wdym I only post with -1 related projects

Probably mr rex

Then idk I‚Äôll check on it later today

"Hey look at me

I‚Äôm becoming a normie

Someone help me"

That is off topic

I‚Äôm so upset at the gbot thing it annoys me

One day @0-1 will wander around and make many friends

I have a bypass though

 so don‚Äôt worry

I am never off topic anymore.

 it‚Äôs very code-related too"

Ooh buttons. I will check on those too

Also I learned that the only approved topics are leader created and leader policed topics

Unicode usernames maybe??

Boo

"Did the Forum invites disappear?

Poking?"

 things like that really make me feel mad as it‚Äôs called Hopscotch Learn To Code for crying out loud! This is not a children‚Äôs chat room! I also don‚Äôt like it when you ask a user what there user on the APP and they say they don‚Äôt use the app. I want to know why the use the Forum when it‚Äôs all about the app!?

Hopscotch Puzzle Competition - Brainstorming Topic

"# The Official Stump Me Topic

>**What is a Stump Me?** - A Stump Me is a puzzle that has to do with the Hopscotch App

 the Forum

 or any challenging puzzle that allows you to think outside of the box to solve it. Anyone can create a Stump Me

 they must be possible (or already completed by the creator). An example Stump Me: What is the Most Liked Post on the Forum

 or What is the Most Liked Post on the Hopscotch App)

>**The Goal of This Topic** - This Topic was made for people to safely create

 solve

 and discuss Stump Me‚Äôs. You are allowed to: Discuss Stump Me‚Äôs

 Solve Stump Me‚Äôs with other users

 Work and Collaborate on Creating Stump Me‚Äôs

 etc. This is a very flexible topic (Experimenting with HTML and Discourse capabilities are very welcome!). This topic is a stress free topic

 if you have any questions or concerns

 please contact one of the Stump Me Leaders. Thank you!

>**Solving a Stump Me** - All of the Official Stump Me‚Äôs are located in the post below. Every Stump Me has been tested and has a solution. Have fun! If you think you have solved a Stump Me

 tag one of the Stump Me Leaders and put your solution in a  folder. If a Stump Me Leaders sees that you have solved it

 your name will be added next to the stump me under solvers. (If a Stump Me is too hard

 you can ask for help or collaborate with other users. Don‚Äôt share your solution or give hints to users

 all hints should be in a folder

 as some users may want to solve the puzzle and figure out the solution for themselves.)

>**Creating a Stump Me** - Would you like to create a stump me? Awesome! This topic was also made for the purpose of trying put html and forum based Stump Me‚Äôs. When you have created a Stump Me

 tag one of the Stump Me Leader‚Äôs and put your Stump Me in a folder. 

>**Stump Me Leaders** - @Petrichor

 @Awesome_E

 @JonnyGamer

Have fun!"

"# Stump Me!

Tons of New Stump Me‚Äôs will be added Weekly. I have created a few right now and will be working in this topic to create more and organize them with the other Stump Me Leaders. If you would like to be notified weekly

 tag me and I‚Äôll put you on the Stump Me Tag List (Or I could have a tag group created).

@Eddie

@Ren"

 thank you! Sounds good

 absolutely"

"Awesome! That is correct. I‚Äôll be adding more to the list!

I wonder what the second most liked forum post and Hopscotch project is? I‚Äôll have to research it"

 and also I‚Äôll add you to the tag list

 thank you so much!"

I will add you to the tag list!"

"I‚Äôm trying to figure out how Petrichor was able to cast a pol in a @ poll thing

 here I‚Äôll show you:

(this one will be added to the stump me challenge)

<details open><a class=mention> 

"What do you mean by ‚Äúthe best‚Äù?

Did you mean the best by the first to questions that I had (because those were only examples

 many other questions will be unrelated)

 or the competition aspect where I‚Äôll put the solvers (which I probably not do

 that could be too much work for me)"

 I see what you mean.

I can promote Hopscotch App-based puzzles with coding problems and etc. instead of centering around Forum based puzzles. That makes sense."

"Oh no! I‚Äôm sorry

 this is a misunderstanding. I had asked Petrichor if he wanted to create a Stump Me Topic and he said he‚Äôd be excited if I did. (I can totally rebrand to something more generic)

(If you want to help too

 that would be greatly appreciated)"

 absolutely. Thank you so much"

Thank you so much! I will add you to the list

<bye petrichor you know how>

 thanks! I‚Äôll add you to the tag list

(I‚Äôm currently in the middle of rethinking the topic)"

 would you like to help me work on this?"

"I have a quick idea that I‚Äôd like to run by:

When someone solves a puzzle by thinking outside of the box

 the ‚Äúah ha‚Äù moment is key for brain-building exercises and for gaining new knowledge and experience about coding (I can see that my first two questions I wrote didn‚Äôt have much to do with programming

 it was just interesting stats). 

Possible questions would include:

- Create a Flappy Bird style game on Hopscotch using only one Text object (The hint would be to use clones).

- Create an app with Bear in which when you tap the screen

 Bear moves towards your finger with a smooth easing function

- Various coding problems using Clones

 Trigonometric Calculations

 Creating While loops by putting a function within its own function (However

 this causes memory issues)

 would it also be possible

 along-side Hopscotch-App puzzles

 to create html-based puzzles as well? The forum is the perfect environment for this

 since it is an html-based platform. An example question (Created by @Petrichor)

 would be:

 - Is it possible to create a folder on the forum that automatically begins opened instead of closed?

This extra idea doesn‚Äôt have to be mainstreamed

 but maybe something just for fun as an extra challenge for those who have completed all of the Hopscotch App Challenges. 

I just had a new idea: I was thinking of creating 10 Hopscotch-based puzzles per week. They would be organized by difficulty (or by theme

 i.e. a cloning based challenge). They would provide plenty of detail and referential material.

It would be super cool to create a compendium of puzzles organized first by theme

 then by difficulty."

I love your new jellyfish profile

Very jelly

-1 appreciates it"

 thank you! This sound great!

 if you mind me asking

 what does OP stand for?)

I was also thinking in the first or second post of the finished topic

 there would be a space to add in new puzzles (so I would use the tag-list once a week to post new puzzles

 but then people could also see previous puzzles in one of the first posts)

 I am very excited. I can‚Äôt wait to hear everyone else‚Äôs ideas"

 that makes sense. I can definitely edit it"

I think the continuous challenges sounds awesome (Like a challenge compendium or something). I‚Äôll figure out an organization method (possibly I‚Äôll include something artistic)

 I love your idea about prizes

 I‚Äôll definitely think of something exciting (Every 10 puzzles completed

 a prize is awarded (every 50 earns a larger prize) (A bonus prize for people who complete a full week‚Äôs challenges) some sort of achievement system would be really cool

Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts and ideas

 brainstorming is awesome!"

 it‚Äôs a falling pyramid

Very cool!"

"All of the

"In a 3x4 grid

 try to fit in as many digits of pi as you can

For example I could do:

3141

And get 13 digits. Start at the 3

 and you can move in any of the 8 directions (up down left right and diagnals)

 which gets you to: 3141592653589

(You can reuse boxes

 that‚Äôs how I got the 9 at the end)

The problem is

 how many digits can you fit in the 3x4? It turns out to be quite a bit!

I proved and found the maximum

 maybe I‚Äôll post it later. It‚Äôs really interesting (There is only 1 maximum actually

 no ties)

Tougher challenge:

Find the maximum digits you can fit in a 3x5 and a 4x4"

Who wants hopscotch to make apps from Hopscotch projects

"This is an epic idea!

I have used drag-and-drop coding software similar to Hopscotch that allows you to publish to the App Store

 but here were the drawbacks:

. You must own your own website 

. You must be 18+ to have a developer license

. It is $99 per year for an Apple developer subscription

. The software put in a long animated splash screen which was annoying

. The app file size was huge for something basic (like 300MB

 A normal app that can be downloaded over Cellular is under 150MB)

. Developing an app for iPad would break on iPhones and newer devices with different screen dimensions

. Cannot publish to Google Play store

. etc

This idea is fabulous

 but it might be hard to get through the legal issues

That‚Äôs probabky how Petrichor does all those stump me‚Äôs like following himself on Hopscotch"

Has the newest tab been removed?

Does the 15 project limit count published projects or drafts?

"Ok that makes sense

I found a way to bypass the 15 rule thingy just now"

"All you have to do is go to the School Version

 then click I‚Äôm a Teacher

Then say you were born in 1980 (also I noticed they don‚Äôt accept ages like born in 1000). Then you type in your email and create an account and you get your own classroom too. 

The school mode allows you to create and/or publish 15+ projects"

 this helps a lot

Thanks üôè"

wo Thank you thank you -1 bestows upon you a great blessing

"It must be because it‚Äôs a teacher school account

oof I may need to provide linkler"

"I must communicate with the all knowing @Petrichor because I remember that you we bestowed with higher privileges

Right now you can do whatever you want on the account. I will soon set up a time for us to talk about our first project (details and planning)

 but it‚Äôs really relaxed.

We will probably subgroup the project and people can work on different things idk I must meet with all knowing petrichor"

"Apparently JonnyGamer was the 73

000th Hopscotcher

 (Now there are over 5 million Hopscotchers)

Only 0.015% of Hopscotchers joined before me

I wonder how many are still active?

I gained access to an account that was around user number 29

0.007% of Hopscotchers came before them!"

"You can find it on the app

 Me > Gear > About

 it will show you your user id

 which happens to be the number of Hopscotchers that there were when you had joined. (It also shows you other stats and alt accounts)"

I‚Äôve found an odd account: [<a class=mention>@Awesome_D</a>](http://tiny.cc/mc6xaz)

They just joined a couple of hours ago.

Their pfp is also quite strange

 so I‚Äôm a tell the Ana so soon

Might be something they want to look into. <a class=mention>@TriggerPolice</a> let‚Äôs get him!"

"Ohhh I see

That makes sense

(But how will new Hopscotchers become noticed?)

I guess it‚Äôs more kid friendly this way"

 the trending and art was annoying

 now Hopscotch is like 100x better

Yes finally

Oke no problemo at all

"iPad 6

[Official] Monthly Feature Recommendations

"Wait seriosly??

uwu time for some.

Nominations"

"Yes quite -1 lives up to many names

First project ideas:

We should do something similar to this:

You found me out

Fine I‚Äôll change it to August hwoops"

"I love these ideas

We should definetely make all of these 

Let‚Äôs build a poll to see which one we should do first (but honestly

 these are all amazing. Maybe we could do multiple WIP projects at the same time)"

"Yes and we can add special Jeffery secrets

I love it

-1 Website -1.0 on the go"

This is perfection

"Hooray! I would love to join the GoodE‚Äôs

-1 blesses you many blessings

-1 questification in progress"

 thank you for our awesome avatar!"

It should be ok since she isn‚Äôt a moderator or leader anymore

"Did you lose it last year because of the @Lisa incedent? I happen to recall it was around June of 2017 super alterior alternative alts

-1 Grants many blessings

Perhaps smol plant?"

I am excited for the new E pad

"I will use

botibo

Being on topic is better option"

"New idea

I made a project a while back

 where I animated emoji‚Äôs to make it look like they were speaking words

This time

 I‚Äôll make pixel art emoji‚Äôs so I can make them say anything I want (and put different sounds as functions so people can easily customize there own speaking emoji). 

I will probably code this up in swift and post an example gif before I put it in Hopscotch (I wish I still had subscription

 I guess I‚Äôll have to use clone art

 this is a job for @Dylan329 )"

"(If you could

 that would be super)

A topic where I could learn would also be amazing

 (since I have no knowledge of the pixel artistry)

What I was thinking of doing is making them in Photoshop first

 and then putting it in Hopscotch (but it might be laggity depending on how detailed the emoji is)"

"Ok yeah

 that‚Äôs perfecco thanks

-1 blesses you most greatly"

"@FearlessPhoenix there should be a Learning category on the forum for old

 but useful topics (So people can find things easily

 or learn something new. This category would be viewable by everyone

 but only TL4s could move a topic into it)"

 I never new that category existed

"Do you think something like this could work?

"Interesting forum stat

The person with the highest average of posts per day

 (must have an anniversary badge) is @SarcasticTvHead

With a 57 ppd average"

 @tankt2016 has an average of 68 ppd if you only count this past year"

 if you only count this past quarter

 @SilverSong has a 104 ppd"

"KVJ is in the 40s (43400 posts / (3 years ~ 1000 days)) is 43

 I‚Äôm being generous

 I think is it is more like 38 ppd)

KVJ has the most posts of all time

 but KVJ‚Äôs average ppd is lower than Stvh‚Äôs. 

(I wasn‚Äôt counting days visited

 just how many days it has been since they joined) (Unless I count days visited

 this could be interesting)"

I used a calculator

"Over 5 million

 I will get an exact number for you in a moment"

"5

281

156 users at this moment

Idk how many are active"

"Lol that‚Äôs awkward 

Ok let‚Äôs gbot I guess

(Ooh I should look into this)"

"Innapropriate content; Language

It happened to me before"

"We‚Äôd have to find the average amount of alt accounts people use on Hopscotch

 and the average amount of devices people use on regular (we could make a topic poll)

But when we find those two averages

 we can get the most likely downloads (unless our poll gets skewed because there are too many people who only make 1 account and leave)"

"Forum Did You Know:

There are only 5 people who joined in 2015 who have posted in the past month who will get there 4th Forum Anniversary Badge this July"

"As of two days ago

There are 2 Lemonade based Game Changer projects now"

"There will be a third

Wait this should be a collab"

"Let‚Äôs make a poll

"I‚Äôm going to make a Jeffery Watch project to compete with your E Pad

yes or no"

"I am working on pixel art currently for Jeffery Can Speake

I will post momentarily

The better question is

How did cocoa viola squeeze in a post 

Literally the GDT topic was closed

Accidentally opened for half a second and closed again

 but cocoa viola managed to post within that half second

There‚Äôs no way 

![image|666x500](upload://yssXC7XfI8iUeZzN8rL9jhXuaRC.png) 

"Now for the tricky part

Making Jeffery Speake

I‚Äôve widdled down all the sounds to 35 letter/sounds. I‚Äôll make post a list so people can double check me

I‚Äôm going to use a system like this within Hopscotch

 so people can easily create there own words using functions"

I‚Äôm worried it will get a little laggy (because Hopscotch is a timing based language it seems) since I need to make the grid 4 times bigger.

Right now I‚Äôm working on making the pixel art for different sounds"

I lost my copy of the CHEINSTTROARLY with the known to be numbers and known not to be numbers portion

"Thank you so mucho

-1 blesses you super powers"

"Hooray! Thank you so much!

-1 was very foolish and lost his copy

-1 blesses you with great powers"

"I also have a question

 is this a secret codde?

[details=secrets]

Nothing secret here 

 the skits are awesome"

Oke I will edit then poor secret code

I edited it out

"We are coding a story into our Hopscotch collab account

 would it be ok to discuss the contents of the story and work on it here?"

"Do you think 2 should be considered a number in the story?

Or is it something that humans have corrupted?"

 topic:52913

Believed to be numbers

1 **2** 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

-1 just wanted to know for sure because -1 is skeptical"

 we will ask him"

 this project is superb great

(I lost my original copy

 so I had to use the contents of the project)"

I have to catch myself up and read the CHEINTTROARLY

It has only been a few millennia and I‚Äôve forgotten some bits"

(In that case I‚Äôll look around the forum for more written skits)

(Unless you have them all saved

 then I won‚Äôt)"

"Hooray! More of the CHEINSTTROARLY is being unearthed

Ever since those humans buried it in a ditch

 now I will work on more pixel art for Speake Jeffery"

"(Actually

 all my code is finished

 and I need to create the sprites <sub> which is the hardest part because I can‚Äôt pixel

 I haven‚Äôt learned </sub> )"

"I really like the secret skits in the project

Very -1"

"I get notified on a lot of clives

 it‚Äôs bringing back a lot of memories"

If Blank Freeze [CLOSED]

"I believe I updated

 my player version is 1.1.0

"Interestingly enough

 when I do

If ___ == ____ { do something }

It will work and do the something

But I guess that makes sense"

"I tried it on a new draft

 new account

 and old draft

 but nothing happens"

"One time I had regular for a long time (if you can believe it)

But I was gone for 3 days and I lost it

 never to gain it again"

"Check this out

"I thought you would just lose 10 points for not adhering to the theme?

"yyyeah

Ok I‚Äôve edited the json and it didn‚Äôt save properly

"It keeps saying ‚Äúcontent unavailable‚Äù whenever I try to use it

Apparently it has to do with me having files that are too large

Yeah it keeps disappearing on me

 not right now. But definetely in the future (I‚Äôm nearly done with the animating

 and then we can do some really cool things with it)

If you‚Äôd like to work on another project

 that would be super great"

Awesome! Thank you!

"Would you like to design a -1 Jeffery website?

"A protototype

 what do you think?"

"This is incredible

 I love the Clear button

 one tap to clear instead of pressing the delete button multiple times to get rid of a 3 digit number.

If we could be able to use larger numbers instead of 64 but numbers

 that would be super super amazing (being able to type cast variables would be even extra super duper)"

What if you did a Fibonacci pattern for the placement of the seeds?

 I could help you

(I am a little bit busy today

 so I will do it tomorrow)"

Thank you! <ksksksk>

 github is still allowed!

Yes yes yes yes yes

Oke I was wondering about that

Verry good"

"I am fascinated by large numbers

Adding large numbers would allow people to code pi to many digits and use advanced decimal computation. Large numbers would also allow us to encode sentences into base 10 so we can store them as variables. Large numbers would allow us to use factorial numbers larger than 23.

(Type casting variables

 such as using Int

 Float

 and Double would also be wonderful)

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this! It really means a lot"

Block Keyboard while Playing

**Your username:** JonnyGamer

**What kind of device are you using?:** iPad 6

**1 sentence description of the problem** I pressed the play button

 and the keyboard didn‚Äôt disappear. When I typed the keyboard

 code still showed up when I pressed the edit button

**Steps that the Hopscotch team can take to reproduce my problem every time:**

1. Idk

2. But if you press a code blocks and play at the same time

 and then press edit

 the code block starts flashing.

Probably a very rare bug (I have the latest Hopscotch version)

(Never mind

 it has happened multiple times

 but I‚Äôm still trying to figure out how to replicate it)

* how do you feel about the current cycle? (On topic --> offtopic --> timer --> (potential close) --> GBOT forcefully --> forced

 repetitive on topic convos --> repeat)

My understanding is that our current cycle is: (On topic convo) -> (Some of Topic convo) -> (GBOT forcefully) -> (potential close) -> (people try to save the topic) -> (One or Two people continue to stay off topic) -> (topic closes)

* how do you think this loop could be broken?

If the one or two people who continue to be off topic listen. (If we had a certain hour of the day committed to off topic conversation

 this issue would probably end)

* suggestions for solving this?

We could have a certain hour of the day dedicated to off topic conversation.

* how do you feel about the convos about code?

This question is too vague

* Are they productive? Helpful?

In a somewhat sort of way (I haven‚Äôt had enough time to gather data on this question)

* how do you feel about the offtopic convos?

I have seen on multiple occasions people being accused of off topic ness

 when they are actually on topic. But the off topic convos don‚Äôt bother me

* are those always appropriate?

* if not

 how can we make sure these are always appropriate?

**Question Thread regarding topic closures:**

* should we change our system?

If we had an hour during the day dedicated to off topic

 it could potentially be very beneficial to the community. We could try this for a day or week to see if you guys think it is appropriate

* how do you guys feel about the 15 min timer?

Idk how the timer works and how Leaders judge whether or not a current discussion is off topic.

* should the time be increased? Decreased?

I like 15 minutes

 it‚Äôs fine

* should we continue to use the timer?

* should we start going by something else?

It‚Äôs hard when one or two people remain off topic (It‚Äôs also hard when one person sabotages a topic just to close it for fun)

* what else would y‚Äôall like us to go by if not the timers?

I like timers

"This is true

 this is something that would need to be worked out

(I‚Äôm assuming most forumers live in the Us)

7.00 - 8.00 am Pacific

6.00 - 7.00 pm Pacific

12.00 - 1.00 am Pacific

Three hours would probably work best for others around the world

 idk how the Leaders need to monitor an Off Topic conversation

Or we could just lax the definition of On Topic"

"That is a good question

If we can discuss anything and everything related to Hopscotch

 Code

 and the Forum

 this topic should work out great

 I‚Äôve witnessed multiple closings

 so I‚Äôm going to do research on what has caused the topic to be closed. I‚Äôve noticed also that most angst is linked to the gbotting and pointing fingers)"

"[details=folder]

I think last night we did very well with the topic timer. (The 7 minutes leading up to the closing was sticking to the rules of the topic) Would it be possible if you could give me more insight to how Leaders judge that this topic should be closed?

 my bad I saw your post after I posted hwoops"

 this makes sense. I really like this approach.

(I know you don‚Äôt want any more questions

 but how would you rate my effort yesterday on getting back on topic? Or did it close because of another reason?)</sub>

I really would like to learn the best strategy of keeping a topic open (It‚Äôs just that I have only witnessed the topic timer closing a topic. I can see that we only posted just so that we could start being on topic (or forcefully being on topic)

 so it makes sense to me that the topic was closed yesterday)"

I‚Äôm so close to finishing my entree in the Summer Competition I am suuuper excited!! (I think I can finish it today!)"

Secondary Form Questions:

Here‚Äôs a sample beta test update. I already put this through my current eBeta group a while ago and found their feedback really useful.

[quote=""Awesome_E""]

## Hey eBeta!

I sketched this up pretty quickly today and I am considering using this for E-Pad

 tell me what you guys think!

A few things you might find useful:

1. Passcode is 1397

 Test that and a few wrong passcodes

2. This is only the enter passcode screen

 the lock screen is already in the E-Pad project

 this is focused on the NumPad and number counter mechanism to store passcode attempts

#### Fill out the following questions:

1. Design-wise

 what did you like about the passcode screen?

It‚Äôs perfect

2. How would you improve the project (like

 looks

 the way digits press

 etc. ‚Äì not ‚Äúthere needs to be text on cancel and a home screen‚Äù)?

3. From an aesthetics perspective

 what are a few things you would do if you had to improve the original E-Pad?

When I saw this one for the first time: [E-Pad](http://tiny.cc/5fbzaz) my mind was blown

4. From a code-oriented perspective

 how would you improve the original E-Pad?

Idk it‚Äôs super epic

5. Is there anything else you would do if you had to improve the original E-Pad?

I‚Äôm excited to see the new version!

6. Just for fun

 guess how many objects are in the original and new E-Pad (so far

 I‚Äôm done with two settings tab

 about 8 options + home and lock screen wallpapers). No screenshots will be given because that‚Äôs for the beta tester updates channel.

-1 guesses a guess of: 200

 both of the apps do the cool motion scale back down

 as if two apps were closed at the same time.

It‚Äôs not really a big deal. You probably don‚Äôt want to add to much code for bug fixes that fix breaky things that people shouldn‚Äôt be doing anyway

I just thought it was interesting because your code runs fine afterwards

I depends on what your definition of fly is

Fly- A bug similar in annoyance to a mosquito

Fly- To go or move quickly (on the fly)

Fly- To wave or flutter through the air (Their hair was flying in the wind)

Fly- The act of time passing swiftly

Fly- To flee

Fly- To be successful

Fly- The act of navigating oneself through the air

In any case

4. Scene Variables (Like the object variables but for scenes)

Strings?? :<m>D"

 ‚ÄúInstead of being a collab topic where users actively discussed their collab and made projects together

 it turned into a project update topic‚Äù

I‚Äôm having trouble seeing the difference. Could you explain more for me

 please?

I‚Äôm getting the sense that THT doesn‚Äôt want a lot of topics. It seems like there has been a lot of consolidation. I just want to confirm that this is the case. The majority of topics types that I currently see are Bug Reports

 Competitions

 and Topics made by Leaders (A few exceptions do exist

 I will admit).

If there could be a tutorial for how and when a topic should be made

 that would be super helpful for users like me.

One question for people:

On a scale of 1 to 10

 how strongly do you feel about having a How To Make a Topic topic

 so that users can be well informed on how their topic should look like

 how it should be ran

[poll type=number results=always min=1 max=10 step=1]

 post:1484

the difference between the gput and the old topic is that instead of collaborating on projects with people (you can use the gdt or just make a topic in most cases)

 you give updates on your projects.

Ok this is starting to make more sense

Are we allowed to share what we‚Äôve made on the collaboration topic?

I think I understand what you mean

"Ohhh I see now

I was misunderstanding the whole time

I turned it into a Projects update Topic because I thought they didn‚Äôt want us chatting about what we were making. I was told

 ‚ÄúWe also need proof of the projects‚Äù so that‚Äôs why I was publishing and sharing as much as I could so that the topic could stay open."

 post:1489

Instead of working on projects together like in a collab you basically just gave updates on project you yourself were making.

You guys weren't actively collabing on them

 I see now. I had misunderstood what the collaboration topic was supposed to be. You had told me that the Leaders wanted proof that we were making projects

 and I took it to mean that I needed the majority of the topic to be posting project updates. (So I was mainly focused on getting projects out instead of discussing anything with anyone)

But now that I better understand

 it makes a lot more sense. A Collaborative Topic is where people discuss ideas for projects

 share and discuss code with other members

 and have fun doing it."

"[details=I do have a favor to ask]

Thank you for your time:

If I were to create a new topic

 and it was outside the guidelines

 I would be extremely grateful if you could give me a reminder/tip before you close the topic. I do not wish to intentionally break the guidelines

 so a reminder would be very much appreciated.

Do you think a beta-testers topic could be something that would work better?

We're looking for more forum leaders!

"Leadership Questionnaire 

* Tell us a bit about your history with Hopscotch. How did you get on the forum?

I heard about the forum from the Hopscotch App about 4 years ago. I have been Hopscotching since nearly the beginning

 and have seen the app and community evolve over the years.

* How often do you use the Hopscotch app? Do you have any favorite types of projects you like to create?

I have used the app quite a bit

 and it was an amazing kickstarting tool to get me interested in programming. Now I‚Äôm learning lower level languages (i.e. Swift

 JavaScript

 HTML

 etc)

* Why do you want to become a leader?

I am willing to answer questions that anyone may have in a respectful way that doesn‚Äôt make the inquirer feel like they are du<j j>mb or not important. I am also willing to use my knowledge of the forum and app to help in any way that I can.

* What do you think leaders‚Äô primary abilities and responsibilities?

To lead the community as positive role models. I am also aware that leaders can close topics

 and edit posts

* What would you change about the forum if you could?

I love the forum

 it‚Äôs a great place to spread ideas and partake in discourse with one another. The Roman Senators used their real life forum as a place to discuss ideas

 politics

 and make decisions. It was also open (only pillars for walls) so that regular everyday citizen could listen in and also participate as well and contribute ideas. I think you have done an incredible job as manager in bringing back this setting.

Thank you @ana for this incredible opportunity!"

Comments

**Fearless:** Honestly this was great. Absolutely hilarious. The design was so simple

 and based on that alone I would‚Äôve given you a 1-2/10 but then there was all this work and complex stuff going on in the background to make it actually look like realistic talking. The trees and emoji dude coulda spawned so much faster 

 or you coulda had a loading screen or something. I also loved the campfire.

I will now proceed to explain why problem solving and creativity got a 2.64. If I‚Äôm being completely honest

 I would‚Äôve given it a 0.27 had Creativity not been a part of that. Before you freak out

 let me explain myself. This category was all about your code and how well you handled challenges. One challenge I can see for you would be the mouth movements. You solved this by using many individual books that easily could‚Äôve been combined. For example

 you had a ‚ÄúWhen Sounds = 1

 Set Yellow‚Äù. Then you had a When sounds = 3

 set yellow. That‚Äôs a lot of individual conditional blocks to do the same thing. You could‚Äôve easily done a ‚ÄúWhen Sounds = 1 and Sounds=3 and ‚Ä¶‚Äù as one conditional and just had a set yellow block there. This all was only in 1 text Object

 and was repeated with all the others (at least 30). This is a lot of unneeded

 excess code that causes lag and is just genuinely messy and unpleasant to scroll through in the editor.

That‚Äôs my only real

 major problem with it. Spawning

 speed and neatness are also problems but none are as major than that. Bugs and problems aside

 that was an amazing

 super creative

 original and fun project.

**Serenity:** the randomized camping ‚Äòtips‚Äô were super funny! but I wasn‚Äôt sure whether to judge this as an actual entry or a parody

 haha. not super complex

 but a fun project to play.

**William:** Funny tips

 well designed and formatted. To be honest though

 it is kinda boring to watch for a longer period of time. Maybe switching up the speech bubbles to display both images

 text

 and sounds between tips? Otherwise

 great work!

**Silvie:** N/A

**MathGirl:** N/A

**Valgo:** This was a unique project

 and it definitely wasn‚Äôt the type of thing I was expecting to see for most of the projects. This can be classified as one of the ‚Äúrandom text generator‚Äù type projects

 but it is very clean and well executed. I found the talking face to be a bit creepy

 but still cool. I also thought some of the tips I got were funny.

Overall

 though this project is part of a common trend on Hopscotch

 it stands above the rest with its great execution and graphics. Cool project

 JonnyGamer!

**Petrichor:** N/A

For the custom title I would be so honored if it could be:

>-1

If at all possible

 I would be eternally grateful if you could add a Zero Width Character in between the ‚Äú-‚Äú and the ‚Äú1‚Äù

AR geopositioning is cool - you can locationally place an object. New LIDAR scanners are legit as supposed and can map out a room. Occlusion now will really occlude.

SwiftUI has some new things - lists and folders. Other magical helpful UI that I‚Äôm so mad they hadn‚Äôt done yet. Added better control flow for this declarative language.

We learned about widgets and app clips - run mini apps on the home screen. Also fake download people‚Äôs apps for mini experiences.

Return results from methods

Optionals arrays any dictionary (if let

‚Äî‚Äî I need to find my post"

Break and Continue Blocks + Naming Control Flow Statements

"### A feature I'd like to see in Hopscotch is:

A ‚Äòbreak‚Äô block.

This block breaks and ends the current control flow statement you are in. (the lowest one)

A ‚Äòcontinue‚Äô block specifically for loops. It immediately ends the current index of the loop

 and goes to the next one.

Also - being able to name Control Flpw statements. Then you can break or continue a specific one like this:

thisHere: if true {

    // this line runs

    if true {

         break thisHere

         // this line wont run

    // this line won‚Äôt run

// immediately hops down here

This could also be a great first step for ‚Äòreturning‚Äô from methods.

#### I'd use it for this type of project:

Any project with huge nested if-while-repeat statements. So you can exit out of them quiccly

#### I've seen something similar in another programming languages

 it looks like this:

Swift has it.

foo: while true {}

Perfect for

- if statements

- while loops

- repeat blocks

- (for-in loops please)

- (switch statements pretty please)"

"# Four is magic (on steroids)

The premise is that all numbers when spelt out in English

 and then you add all the letters together to form a new number

 and then you continue forever

 will always go to 4.

I.e. 100 = one hundred

 10 ten

 3 three

 5 five

 4 four (4 has four letters we‚Äôre done)

My puzzle is very similar.. But with 1 major component

Take 100 for example

It‚Äôs written as ‚Äòone hundred‚Äô

3 letters

 and 7 letters

Instead of adding 3 and 7

 multiply them!

100 -> 21 -> 18 -> 8 -> 5 -> 4

With this new rule

 are there any other *stable* numbers (or number sequences) other than four?

I‚Äôll give you a hint:

24 = twenty-four = 6 * 4 = 24

If you find any more

 That‚Äôll earn you some -1 coin!"

By far this is my favorite quote today:

"Fun factoid:

1 and -1 were considered prime numbers

 until people forgot.

I consider this a great blunder.

All numbers are divisible by 2 -1s. Which is a secret truth that -1 will finally destroy +2 in the end.

Yes indeed. On twosday even."

 with nothing but a thin partition to separate it

 he overheard these words

 ""As you live

 Se√±or Don Jeronimo

 while they are bringing supper

 let us read another chapter of the Second Part of *Don Quixote of La Mancha*"".

>	The instant Don Quixote heard his own name he started to his feet and listened with open ears to catch what they said about him

 and heard the Don Jeronimo who had been adressed say in reply

 ""Why would you have us read that absurd stuff

 Don Juan

 when it is impossible for any one who has read the First Part of the history of *Don Quoxite of La Mancha* to take any pleasure in reading this Second Part?""

Alternative accounts are not allowed so that we can prevent spam in the forum. There are also not a lot of reasons why one would ever need an alt account. If everyone starts making lots of accounts

 we might have too many duplicate contents on the forum. This is so that the forum can stay clean and moderated.

Hi there! I‚Äôm JonnyGamer! Nice to meet you!

- most liked

- most branched

- newest

Soon they were replaced by other filters and categories.

500

 here‚Äôs my question:

The name is -num I think

"See that would be very very clever

I need to learn the structure of the Hopcptch JSON though. That would be very awesome however: what a grand idea awesome e"

"Oh! Awesome! Thank you!

What kind of data structures can be created? I‚Äôm planning on adding functionality for building custom classes

 structs

 enums."

Custom blocks will render but won‚Äôt have a color

Oooh this will be super cool then!

Ok I‚Äôm very excited and bookmarked the post. Thanks so much !!!"

":0:0:0 oooooOOOOoooo

So would my Swift code extensions be able to run? Y/N

Or would I have to make it conform exactly with Hopscotch?"

owowo !"

"How come you are a floating orb ?

That means you can float away away - how many times have you done that ?

Which way can I go?"

And you wont take over earth

I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs way too late for that

 the super number. You must know this because the end is approaching. All of your hopscotch projects are now mine !"

Curly brackets are way better than indentation I agree way better - how clever of you to do this

"So basically

If I pick the rhino

I mean it‚Äôs gonna be a close one between ox and gator ‚Äî‚Äî1 hmmm.... 

@everyone which amazong onomol should -1 choose ? I‚Äôll choose the one with the lowest votes:

Remixing is supposed to be someone that riffs off ur projects but now they rip off ur projects.

Agreed here‚Äôs some solutions:

Remixes must contain at least 1 line of code that has been changed. Otherwise it‚Äôs like: why. Slight problem though due to the glitch where you can remix a project except erase the remix sign.

Some choices that should be given to publishers:

- allow people to view your code (y/n)

- if so: allow people to edit your code (y/n)

- if so: allow people to make a draft of your project (y/n)

- if so: allow people to remix your project (freely without credit / freely but with credit / approval and consent only / paid with n seeds / some custom condition / never)

- if so: who obtains the seeds gained from a remixed project? (no one / only the remixer / both contributers / only the original creator)"

Very very good project - they will all know the true side very soon. Yes indeed"

@Petrichor I can see you and what you‚Äôre working on

hmm <suspect>

But -1 knows better now"

"Hi says -1

Yes I‚Äôm attempted to code something special as you well know. It‚Äôs very ‚Äî1 and coming along nicely

 you‚Äôll see later.

One problem is I‚Äôm running a very old version of hopscotch on a very old device so I need to update both for it to work perfectly

Are you attempting to code anything so lately ?"

"I‚Äôm sorry

I did not mean for you to be so hesitant about -1.

You must not waste another moment. -1 is here !"

"So there isn‚Äôt.

You have to delete them and remake them. (I think maybe you can even just rename them) - however this is really tricky to pull off correctly without mistakes

Same thing with functions. I tried to do this with functions by creating them alphabetically

 but I forgot one after I made them all and got super sad.

Make a feature request

Or I will

Too late I‚Äôm going to"

Rearrange Variables and Custom Blocks

I‚Äôm pretty sure we‚Äôve all wished for this feature before..

The ability to strategically rearrange

 or alphabetize the following:

- global variables

- custom blocks

- custom rules

Any project. But more specifically:

Any project with a lot of variables and/or custom blocks.

Currently

 finding my variables or custom blocks is like being forced to play ‚ÄúI Spy‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Waldo‚Äù. 

#### Here are some examples of Hopscotch code that could be improved if we had this:

 when I made so many

 it got so very frustrating and time consuming because whenever I wanted to use one

 I‚Äôd have to look for it.

If you edit the code and view my custom blocks

 you can see that some portions are alphabetical (which I had to do by hand) and others are not.

It‚Äôs not a happy place. Not at all.

#### Here is an example design I've made:

Here‚Äôs a pretty clever idea:

[quote=""anisotr0py

 post:7641

Long presses bring up the choices to rename or delete them

 but I want to rearrange them like iOS app icons.

This feature should be relatively simple to add.

Even if the implementation was as minor as a toggle to determine how to sort the variables and blocks

 it would go a long way. 

#### I've seen something similar in other programming languages

You just rearrange your variables or functions. With text based programming languages

 it‚Äôs very simple: cut and paste.

Some languages have static variables and static functions that are grouped within objects so they can even be organized by category.

# Community Poll

Select the option(s) that you are good with:

[poll type=multiple results=always min=1 max=3 chartType=bar]

* Idea 1: Ability to rearrange variables and custom blocks

 just like how I can rearrange my code.

* Idea 2:

Option to sort my variables and custom blocks alphabetically

 chronologically

* Idea 3: Ability to group variables and custom blocks into categories and subcategories for more perfect organization.

* Any of these ideas will make my life much better and will allow me to code even faster.

* I‚Äôll still live if there are no changes

Is this possible with JSON hacking

 if it came to it?

Maybe. I‚Äôd ask @Awesome_E"

Is touching as a conditional

"So this is a discussion between imperative and declarative programming.

Imperative programming is like using an infinite loop to control your code (i.e. update function) to constantly check conditions.

Declarative programming is reaction based. You only execute a program when a specific event occurs (I.e. touch began

Hopscotch is a declarative language. Using ‚Äúwhen 7 == 7‚Äù or ‚Äúwhen x == y‚Äù makes it imperative and can cause lag in your projects if overused. Try an alternative route.

So what does this all mean?

 instead of saying

- when n == 7: check if touching 

Try coding this instead:

- when touching: check if n == 7"

"Oh no my bad I messed up on the poll.

It was supposed to let you choose as many options as you liked. My mistake."

"[quote=""Henry

 topic:60842""]

unnecessary

Since all functions and variables in Hopscotch are global (they are all created/initialized at the same time)

 you are right in saying that this feature request is unnecessary.

One idea I just thought of: However

 if Hopscotch plans to add local variables in the future (who knows) this feature will be crucial.

But in the meantime

 being able to organize variables and others will make some of us a lot more happy. But it all depends on how much more happy it will make us

 and if that happiness is worth the dev time. My bet is that it is."

"World Wide Developer‚Äôs Conference

Apple will announce homeOS for their home pods."

I‚Äôll take a look at it

"Very nice project!

This is a very advanced clone project

Yes you programmed them in a declarative way.

Instead of them all having their own ‚Äúwhen 7 == 7‚Äù loop

 they react to a specific event. This makes the project less laggy. Great work! (I wish I could look at the code

 but I‚Äôm unable to due to my device being that old and

 but I think I understand the gist of it)

I do like the nice sine pattern that they form. Very cool- and it‚Äôs adjustable which is very cool cool  

Ooh I‚Äôm looking at all of your projects and am following you now. Lots of clever code I see !"

"Do

Do

Do you want to be followed too?"

Ok consider it done

Oops followed you too

"Ooh I did not see that before

That‚Äôs super handy. Wo !"

"Ok so which account are you?

I followed .GOATGAMESüêê"

Yeah I think I followed the wrong person I‚Äôll try again

Ok I for sure did it now

 post:7688

check itself when there is a variable change?

I don‚Äôt think Hopscptch has ‚Äòwillset‚Äô or ‚Äòdidset‚Äô property observers.

There may be a way to do it

 but I‚Äôll have to think some."
