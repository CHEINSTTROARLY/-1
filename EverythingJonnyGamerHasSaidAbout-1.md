 like their first video the 11.11.11 all about eleven. I also like the infinite series one where 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1... = 1/2 and 1 + 2 + 3 + 4... = -1/12. I don't know if I have a favorite
It can zoom down to 10^-13 and is very detailed. Awesome!
 like 1 + 2 + 3 + 4.. = -1/12. It's a lot of fun
They are spitting out numbers in between -1 and 1
"e^(i * pi) = -1
 the result is ""-1""
This guy? Looks like he joined recently.. I hope it is a joke. Why does he have -1 posts? Weird
